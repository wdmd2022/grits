# let's set up an api server for fun

run:
```
docker-compose up --build
```

in the project directory after you clone it.

Go to http://localhost:80 to check out the front end.
Log in with test credentials:
username: llcooldoug
api key: t3stk3y1337

Want to query the API directly?
It's on localhost:5000, but you'll want to check out "Design Documents" for more information on how to query it.
