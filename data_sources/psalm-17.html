<pre>   1  Lord, hear the right, attend my cry,
         unto my pray'r give heed,
      That doth not in hypocrisy
         from feigned lips proceed.</pre>

<pre>   2  And from before thy presence forth
         my sentence do thou send:
      Toward these things that equal are
         do thou thine eyes intend.</pre>

<pre>   3  Thou prov'dst mine heart, thou visit'dst me
         by night, thou didst me try,
      Yet nothing found'st; for that my mouth
         shall not sin, purposed I.</pre>

<pre>   4  As for men's works, I, by the word
         that from thy lips doth flow,
      Did me preserve out of the paths
         wherein destroyers go.</pre>

<pre>   5  Hold up my goings, Lord, me guide
         in those thy paths divine,
      So that my footsteps may not slide
         out of those ways of thine.</pre>

<pre>   6  I called have on thee, O God,
          because thou wilt me hear:
       That thou may'st hearken to my speech,
          to me incline thine ear.</pre>

<pre>   7  Thy wondrous loving-kindness show,
         thou that, by thy right hand,
      Sav'st them that trust in thee from those
         that up against them stand.</pre>

<pre>   8  As th' apple of the eye me keep;
         in thy wings shade me close
   9  From lewd oppressors, compassing
         me round, as deadly foes.</pre>

<pre>  10  In their own fat they are enclosed;
         their mouth speaks loftily.
  11  Our steps they compassed; and to ground
         down bowing set their eye.</pre>

<pre>  12  He like unto a lion is
         that's greedy of his prey,
      Or lion young, which lurking doth
         in secret places stay.</pre>

<pre>  13  Arise, and disappoint my foe,
         and cast him down, O Lord:
      My soul save from the wicked man,
         the man which is thy sword.</pre>

<pre>  14  From men, which are thy hand, O Lord,
         from worldly men me save,
      Which only in this present life
         their part and portion have.</pre>

<pre>      Whose belly with thy treasure hid
         thou fill'st: they children have
      In plenty; of their goods the rest
         they to their children leave.</pre>

<pre>  15  But as for me, I thine own face
         in righteousness will see;
      And with thy likeness, when I wake,
         I satisfied shall be.</pre>
