 <pre>
        1  O praise the Lord, for he is good;
              his mercy lasteth ever.
        2  Let those of Israel now say,
              His mercy faileth never.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        3  Now let the house of Aaron say,
              His mercy lasteth ever.
        4  Let those that fear the Lord now say,
              His mercy faileth never.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        5  I in distress call'd on the Lord;
              the Lord did answer me:
           He in a large place did me set,
              from trouble made me free.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        6  The mighty Lord is on my side,
              I will not be afraid;
           For any thing that man can do
              I shall not be dismay'd.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        7  The Lord doth take my part with them
              that help to succour me:
           Therefore on those that do me hate
              I my desire shall see.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        8  Better it is to trust in God
              than trust in man's defence;
        9  Better to trust in God than make
              princes our confidence.
 </pre>

<pre>
       10  The nations, joining all in one,
              did compass me about:
           But in the Lord's most holy name
              I shall them all root out.
</pre>

<pre>
       11  They compass'd me about; I say,
              they compass'd me about:
           But in the Lord's most holy name
              I shall them all root out.
</pre>

<pre>
       12  Like bees they compass'd me about;
              like unto thorns that flame
           They quenched are: for them shall I
              destroy in God's own name.
</pre>

<pre>
       13  Thou sore hast thrust, that I might fall,
              but my Lord helped me.
       14  God my salvation is become,
              my strength and song is he.
</pre>

<pre>
       15  In dwellings of the righteous
              is heard the melody
           Of joy and health: the Lord's right hand
              doth ever valiantly.
</pre>

<pre>
       16  The right hand of the mighty Lord
              exalted is on high;
           The right hand of the mighty Lord
              doth ever valiantly.
</pre>

<pre>
       17  I shall not die, but live, and shall
              the works of God discover.
       18  The Lord hath me chastised sore,
              but not to death giv'n over.
</pre>

<pre>
       19  O set ye open unto me
              the gates of righteousness;
           Then will I enter into them,
              and I the Lord will bless.
</pre>

<pre>
       20  This is the gate of God, by it
              the just shall enter in.
       21  Thee will I praise, for thou me heard'st
              and hast my safety been.
</pre>

<pre>
       22  That stone is made head corner-stone,
              which builders did despise:
       23  This is the doing of the Lord,
              and wondrous in our eyes.
</pre>

<pre>
       24  This is the day God made, in it
              we'll joy triumphantly.
       25  Save now, I pray thee, Lord; I pray,
              send now prosperity.
</pre>

<pre>
       26  Blessed is he in God's great name
              that cometh us to save:
           We, from the house which to the Lord
              pertains, you blessed have.
</pre>

<pre>
       27  God is the Lord, who unto us
              hath made light to arise:
           Bind ye unto the altar's horns
              with cords the sacrifice.
</pre>

<pre>
       28  Thou art my God, I'll thee exalt;
              my God, I will thee praise.
       29  Give thanks to God, for he is good:
              his mercy lasts always.
