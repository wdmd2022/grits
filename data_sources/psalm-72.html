<p><em><font FACE="Times New Roman">A Psalm for Solomon. </font></em></p>

<pre>   1  O Lord, thy judgments give the king,
         his son thy righteousness.
   2  With right he shall thy people judge,
         thy poor with uprightness.</pre>

<pre>   3  The lofty mountains shall bring forth
         unto the people peace;
      Likewise the little hills the same
         shall do by righteousness.</pre>

<pre>   4  The people's poor ones he shall judge,
         the needy's children save;
      And those shall he in pieces break
         who them oppressed have.</pre>

<pre>   5  They shall thee fear, while sun and moon
         do last, through ages all.
   6  Like rain on mown grass he shall drop,
         or show'rs on earth that fall.</pre>

<pre>   7  The just shall flourish in his days,
         and prosper in his reign:
      He shall, while doth the moon endure,
         abundant peace maintain.</pre>

<pre>   8  His large and great dominion shall
         from sea to sea extend:
      It from the river shall reach forth
         unto earth's utmost end.</pre>

<pre>   9  They in the wilderness that dwell
         bow down before him must;
      And they that are his enemies
         shall lick the very dust.</pre>

<pre>  10  The kings of Tarshish, and the isles,
         to him shall presents bring;
      And unto him shall offer gifts
         Sheba's and Seba's king.</pre>

<pre>  11  Yea, all the mighty kings on earth
         before him down shall fall;
      And all the nations of the world
         do service to him shall.</pre>

<pre>  12  For he the needy shall preserve,
         when he to him doth call;
      The poor also, and him that hath
         no help of man at all.</pre>

<pre>  13  The poor man and the indigent
         in mercy he shall spare;
      He shall preserve alive the souls
         of those that needy are.</pre>

<pre>  14  Both from deceit and violence
         their soul he shall set free;
      And in his sight right precious
         and dear their blood shall be.</pre>

<pre>  15  Yea, he shall live, and giv'n to him
         shall be of Sheba's gold:
      For him still shall they pray, and he
         shall daily be extolled.</pre>

<pre>  16  Of corn an handful in the earth
         on tops of mountains high,
      With prosp'rous fruit shall shake, like trees
         on Lebanon that be.</pre>

<pre>      The city shall be flourishing,
         her citizens abound
      In number shall, like to the grass
         that grows upon the ground.</pre>

<pre>  17  His name for ever shall endure;
         last like the sun it shall:
      Men shall be blessed in him, and blessed
         all nations shall him call.</pre>

<pre>  18  Now blessèd be the Lord our God,
         the God of Israel,
      For he alone doth wondrous works,
         in glory that excel.</pre>

<pre>  19  And blessèd be his glorious name
         to all eternity:
      The whole earth let his glory fill.
         Amen, so let it be.</pre>
