</blockquote>

 <pre>
    1  The wicked man's transgression
          within my heart thus says,
       Undoubtedly the fear of God
          is not before his eyes.
 </pre>

 <pre>
    2  Because himself he flattereth
          in his own blinded eye,
       Until the hatefulness be found
          of his iniquity.
 </pre>

 <pre>
    3  Words from his mouth proceeding are,
          fraud and iniquity:
       He to be wise, and to do good,
          hath left off utterly.
 </pre>

 <pre>
    4  He mischief, lying on his bed,
          most cunningly doth plot:
       He sets himself in ways not good,
          ill he abhorreth not.
 </pre>

 <pre>
    5  Thy mercy, Lord, is in the heav'ns;
          thy truth doth reach the clouds:
    6  Thy justice is like mountains great;
          thy judgments deep as floods:
 </pre>

    <pre>
       Lord, thou preservest man and beast.
        7      How precious is thy grace!
       Therefore in shadow of thy wings
          men's sons their trust shall place.
    </pre>

 <pre>
    8  They with the fatness of thy house
          shall be well satisfied;
       From rivers of thy pleasures thou
          wilt drink to them provide.
 </pre>

 <pre>
    9  Because of life the fountain pure
          remains alone with thee;
       And in that purest light of thine
          we clearly light shall see.
 </pre>

<pre>
   10  Thy loving-kindness unto them
          continue that thee know;
       And still on men upright in heart
          thy righteousness bestow.
</pre>

<pre>
   11  Let not the foot of cruel pride
          come, and against me stand;
       And let me not removed be,
          Lord, by the wicked's hand.
</pre>

<pre>
   12  There fallen are they, and ruined,
          that work iniquities:
       Cast down they are, and never shall
          be able to arise.
</pre>
