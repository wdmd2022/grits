<p><em>To the chief musician upon Shoshannim, Eduth, A Psalm of Asaph. </em></p>

<pre>   1  Hear, Isr'el's Shepherd! like a flock
         thou that dost Joseph guide;
      Shine forth, O thou that dost between
         the cherubims abide.</pre>

<pre>   2  In Ephraim's, and Benjamin's
         and in Manasseh's sight,
      O come for our salvation;
         stir up thy strength and might.</pre>

<pre>   3  Turn us again, O Lord our God,
         and upon us vouchsafe
      To make thy countenance to shine,
         and so we shall be safe.</pre>

<pre>   4  O Lord of hosts, almighty God,
         how long shall kindled be
      Thy wrath against the prayer made
         by thine own folk to thee? </pre>

<pre>   5  Thou tears of sorrow giv'st to them
         instead of bread to eat;
      Yea, tears instead of drink thou giv'st
         to them in measure great.</pre>

<pre>   6  Thou makest us a strife unto
         our neighbours round about;
      Our enemies among themselves
         at us do laugh and flout.</pre>

<pre>   7  Turn us again, O God of hosts,
         and upon us vouchsafe
      To make thy countenance to shine,
         and so we shall be safe.</pre>

<pre>   8  A vine from Egypt brought thou hast,
         by thine outstretched hand;
      And thou the heathen out didst cast,
         to plant it in their land.</pre>

<pre>   9  Before it thou a room didst make,
         where it might grow and stand;
      Thou causedst it deep root to take,
         and it did fill the land.</pre>

<pre>  10  The mountains vail'd were with its shade,
         as with a covering;
      Like goodly cedars were the boughs
         which out from it did spring. </pre>

<pre>  11  Upon the one hand to the sea
         her boughs she did out send;
      On th' other side unto the flood
         her branches did extend. </pre>

<pre>  12  Why hast thou then thus broken down,
         and ta'en her hedge away?
      So that all passengers do pluck,
         and make of her a prey. </pre>

<pre>  13  The boar who from the forest comes
         doth waste it at his pleasure;
      The wild beast of the field also
         devours it out of measure. </pre>

<pre>  14  O God of hosts, we thee beseech,
         return now unto thine;
      Look down from heav'n in love, behold,
         and visit this thy vine: </pre>

<pre>  15  This vineyard, which thine own right hand
         hath planted us among;
      And that same branch, which for thyself
         thou hast made to be strong. </pre>

<pre>  16  Burnt up it is with flaming fire,
         it also is cut down:
      They utterly are perished,
         when as thy face doth frown. </pre>

<pre>  17  O let thy hand be still upon
         the Man of thy right hand,
      The Son of man, whom for thyself
         thou madest strong to stand. </pre>

<pre>  18  So henceforth we will not go back,
         nor turn from thee at all:
      O do thou quicken us, and we
         upon thy name will call.</pre>

<pre>  19  Turn us again, Lord God of hosts,
         and upon us vouchsafe
      To make thy countenance to shine,
         and so we shall be safe.</pre>
