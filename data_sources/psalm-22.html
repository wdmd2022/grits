<pre><em><font FACE="Times New Roman">To the chief Musician upon Aijeleth Shahar,
A Psalm of David.</font></em>

   1  My God, my God, why hast thou me
         forsaken? why so far
      Art thou from helping me, and from
         my words that roaring are?</pre>

<pre>   2  All day, my God, to thee I cry,
         yet am not heard by thee;
      And in the season of the night
         I cannot silent be.</pre>

<pre>   3  But thou art holy, thou that dost
         inhabit Isr'el's praise.
   4  Our fathers hoped in thee, they hoped
         and thou didst them release.</pre>

<pre>   5  When unto thee they sent their cry,
         to them deliv'rance came:
      Because they put their trust in thee,
         they were not put to shame.</pre>

<pre>   6  But as for me, a worm I am,
         and as no man am prized:
      Reproach of men I am, and by
         the people am despised.</pre>

<pre>   7  All that me see laugh me to scorn;
         shoot out the lip do they;
      They nod and shake their heads at me,
         and, mocking, thus do say,</pre>

<pre>   8  This man did trust in God, that he
         would free him by his might:
      Let him deliver him, sith he
         had in him such delight.</pre>

<pre>   9  But thou art he out of the womb
         that didst me safely take;
      When I was on my mother's breasts
         thou me to hope didst make.</pre>

<pre>  10  And I was cast upon thy care,
         ev'n from the womb till now;
      And from my mother's belly, Lord,
         my God and guide art thou.</pre>

<pre>  11  Be not far off, for grief is near,
         and none to help is found.
  12  Bulls many compass me, strong bulls
         of Bashan me surround.</pre>

<pre>  13  Their mouths they opened wide on me,
         upon me gape did they,
      Like to a lion ravening
         and roaring for his prey.</pre>

<pre>  14  Like water I'm poured out, my bones
         all out of joint do part:
      Amidst my bowels, as the wax,
         so melted is my heart.</pre>

<pre>  15  My strength is like a potsherd dried;
         my tongue it cleaveth fast
      Unto my jaws; and to the dust
         of death thou brought me hast.</pre>

<pre>  16  For dogs have compassed me about:
         the wicked, that did meet
      In their assembly, me enclosed;
         they pierced my hands and feet.</pre>

<pre>  17  I all my bones may tell; they do
         upon me look and stare.
  18  Upon my vesture lots they cast,
         and clothes among them share.</pre>

<pre>  19  But be not far, O Lord, my strength;
         haste to give help to me.
  20  From sword my soul, from pow'r of dogs
         my darling set thou free.</pre>

<pre>  21  Out of the roaring lion's mouth
         do thou me shield and save:
      For from the horns of unicorns
         an ear to me thou gave.</pre>

<pre>  22  I will show forth thy name unto
         those that my brethren are;
      Amidst the congregation
         thy praise I will declare.</pre>

<pre>  23  Praise ye the Lord, who do him fear;
         him glorify all ye
      The seed of Jacob: fear him all
         that Isr'el's children be.</pre>

<pre>  24  For he despised not nor abhorred
         th' afflicted's misery;
      Nor from him hid his face, but heard
         when he to him did cry.</pre>

<pre>  25  Within the congregation great
         my praise shall be of thee;
      My vows before them that him fear
         shall be performed by me.</pre>

<pre>  26  The meek shall eat, and shall be filled;
         they also praise shall give
      Unto the Lord that do him seek:
         your heart shall ever live.</pre>

<pre>  27  All ends of th' earth remember shall,
         and turn the Lord unto;
      All kindreds of the nations
         to him shall homage do:</pre>

<pre>  28  Because the kingdom to the Lord
         doth appertain as his;
      Likewise among the nations
         the Governor he is.</pre>

<pre>  29  Earth's fat ones eat, and worship shall:
         all who to dust descend
      Shall bow to him; none of them can
         his soul from death defend.</pre>

<pre>  30  A seed shall service do to him;
         unto the Lord it shall
      Be for a generation
         reckonrd in ages all.</pre>

<pre>  31  They shall come, and they shall declare
         his truth and righteousness
      Unto a people yet unborn,
         and that he hath done this.</pre>
