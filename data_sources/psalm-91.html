<pre>   1  He that doth in the secret place
         of the most High reside,
      Under the shade of him that is
         th' Almighty shall abide.</pre>

<pre>   2  I of the Lord my God will say,
         He is my refuge still,
      He is my fortress, and my God,
         and in him trust I will.</pre>

<pre>   3  Assuredly he shall thee save,
         and give deliverance
      From subtle fowler's snare, and from
         the noisome pestilence.</pre>

<pre>   4  His feathers shall thee hide; thy trust
         under his wings shall be:
      His faithfulness shall be a shield
         and buckler unto thee.</pre>

<pre>   5  Thou shalt not need to be afraid
         for terrors of the night;
      Nor for the arrow that doth fly
         by day, while it is light;</pre>

<pre>   6  Nor for the pestilence, that walks
         in darkness secretly;
      Nor for destruction, that doth waste
         at noon-day openly.</pre>

<pre>   7  A thousand at thy side shall fall,
         on thy right hand shall lie
      Ten thousand dead; yet unto thee
         it shall not once come nigh.</pre>

<pre>   8  Only thou with thine eyes shalt look,
         and a beholder be;
      And thou therein the just reward
         of wicked men shalt see.</pre>

<pre>   9  Because the Lord, who constantly
         my refuge is alone,
      Ev'n the most High, is made by thee
         thy habitation;</pre>

<pre>  10  No plague shall near thy dwelling come;
         no ill shall thee befall:
  11  For thee to keep in all thy ways
         his angels charge he shall.</pre>

<pre>  12  They in their hands shall bear thee up,
         still waiting thee upon;
      Lest thou at any time should'st dash
         thy foot against a stone.</pre>

<pre>  13  Upon the adder thou shalt tread,
         and on the lion strong;
      Thy feet on dragons trample shall,
         and on the lions young.</pre>

<pre>  14  Because on me he set his love,
         I'll save and set him free;
      Because my great name he hath known,
         I will him set on high.</pre>

<pre>  15  He'll call on me, I'll answer him;
         I will be with him still
      In trouble, to deliver him,
         and honor him I will.</pre>

<pre>  16  With length of days unto his mind
         I will him satisfy;
      I also my salvation
         will cause his eyes to see.</pre>
