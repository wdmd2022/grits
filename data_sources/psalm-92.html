<pre>   1  To render thanks unto the Lord
         it is a comely thing,
      And to thy name, O thou most High,
         due praise aloud to sing.</pre>

<pre>   2  Thy loving-kindness to show forth
         when shines the morning light;
      And to declare thy faithfulness
         with pleasure ev'ry night.</pre>

<pre>   3  On a ten-stringed instrument,
         upon the psaltery,
      And on the harp with solemn sound,
         and grave sweet melody.</pre>

<pre>   4  For thou, Lord, by thy mighty works
         hast made my heart right glad;
      And I will triumph in the works
         which by thine hands were made.</pre>

<pre>   5  How great, Lord, are thy works! each thought
         of thine a deep it is:
   6  A brutish man it knoweth not;
         fools understand not this.</pre>

<pre>   7  When those that lewd and wicked are
         spring quickly up like grass,
      And workers of iniquity
         do flourish all apace;</pre>

<pre>      It is that they for ever may
         destroyed be and slain;
   8  But thou, O Lord, art the most High,
         for ever to remain.</pre>

<pre>   9  For, lo, thine enemies, O Lord,
         thine en'mies perish shall;
      The workers of iniquity
         shall be dispersed all.</pre>

<pre>  10  But thou shalt, like unto the horn
         of th' unicorn, exalt
      My horn on high: thou with fresh oil
            anoint me also shalt.</pre>

<pre>  11  Mine eyes shall also my desire
         see on mine enemies;
      Mine ears shall of the wicked hear
         that do against me rise.</pre>

<pre>  12  But like the palm-tree flourishing
         shall be the righteous one;
      He shall like to the cedar grow
         that is in Lebanon.</pre>

<pre>  13  Those that within the house of God
         are planted by his grace,
      They shall grow up, and flourish all
         in our God's holy place.</pre>

<pre>  14  And in old age, when others fade,
         they fruit still forth shall bring;
      They shall be fat, and full of sap,
         and aye be flourishing;</pre>

<pre>  15  To show that upright is the Lord:
         he is a rock to me;
      And he from all unrighteousness
         is altogether free.</pre>
