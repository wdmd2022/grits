<pre>   1  Ye righteous, in the Lord rejoice;
         it comely is and right,
      That upright men, with thankful voice,
         should praise the Lord of might.</pre>

<pre>   2  Praise God with harp, and unto him
         sing with the psaltery;
      Upon a ten-stringed instrument
         make ye sweet melody.</pre>

<pre>   3  A new song to him sing, and play
         with loud noise skilfully;
   4  For right is God's word, all his works
         are done in verity.</pre>

<pre>   5  To judgment and to righteousness
         a love he beareth still;
      The loving-kindness of the Lord
         the earth throughout doth fill.</pre>

<pre>   6  The heavens by the word of God
         did their beginning take;
      And by the breathing of his mouth
         he all their hosts did make.</pre>

<pre>   7  The waters of the seas he brings
         together as an heap;
      And in storehouses, as it were,
         he layeth up the deep.</pre>

<pre>   8  Let earth, and all that live therein,
         with rev'rence fear the Lord;
      Let all the world's inhabitants
         dread him with one accord.</pre>

<pre>   9  For he did speak the word, and done
         it was without delay;
      Establishèd it firmly stood,
         whatever he did say.</pre>

<pre>  10  God doth the counsel bring to naught
         which heathen folk do take;
      And what the people do devise
         of none effect doth make.</pre>

<pre>  11  O but the counsel of the Lord
         doth stand for ever sure;
      And of his heart the purposes
         from age to age endure.</pre>

<pre>  12  That nation blessèd is, whose God
         Jehovah is, and those
      A blessèd people are, whom for
         his heritage he chose.</pre>

<pre>  13  The Lord from heav'n sees and beholds
         all sons of men full well:
  14  He views all from his dwelling-place
         that in the earth do dwell.</pre>

<pre>  15  He forms their hearts alike, and all
         their doings he observes.
  16  Great hosts save not a king, much strength
         no mighty man preserves.</pre>

<pre>  17  An horse for preservation
         is a deceitful thing;
      And by the greatness of his strength
         can no deliv'rance bring.</pre>

<pre>  18  Behold on those that do him fear
         the Lord doth set his eye;
      Ev'n those who on his mercy do
         with confidence rely.</pre>

<pre>  19  From death to free their soul, in dearth
         life unto them to yield.
  20  Our soul doth wait upon the Lord;
         he is our help and shield.</pre>

<pre>  21  Since in his holy name we trust,
         our heart shall joyful be.
  22  Lord, let thy mercy be on us,
         as we do hope in thee.</pre>
