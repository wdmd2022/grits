<p><em>To the chief Musician upon Muth-labben, A Psalm of David.</em></p>

<pre>   1  Lord, thee I'll praise with all my heart,
         thy wonders all proclaim.
   2  In thee, most High, I'll greatly joy,
         and sing unto thy name.</pre>

<pre>   3  When back my foes were turned, they fell,
         and perished at thy sight:
   4  For thou maintain'dst my right and cause;
         on throne sat'st judging right.</pre>

<pre>   5  The heathen thou rebuked hast,
         the wicked overthrown;
      Thou hast put out their names, that they
         may never more be known.</pre>

<pre>   6  O en'my! now destructions have
         an end perpetual:
      Thou cities razed; perished with them
         is their memorial.</pre>

<pre>   7  God shall endure for aye; he doth
         for judgment set his throne;
   8  In righteousness to judge the world,
         justice to give each one.</pre>

<pre>   9  God also will a refuge be
         for those that are oppressed;
      A refuge will he be in times
         of trouble to distressed.</pre>

<pre>  10  And they that know thy name, in thee
         their confidence will place:
      For thou hast not forsaken them
         that truly seek thy face.</pre>

<pre>  11  O sing ye praises to the Lord,
         that dwells in Zion hill;
      And all the nations among
         his deeds record ye still.</pre>

<pre>  12  When he enquireth after blood,
         he then rememb'reth them:
      The humble folk he not forgets
         that call upon his name.</pre>

<pre>  13  Lord, pity me; behold the grief
         which I from foes sustain;
      Ev'n thou, who from the gates of death
         dost raise me up again;</pre>

<pre>  14  That I, in Zion's daughters' gates,
         may all thy praise advance;
      And that I may rejoice always
         in thy deliverance.</pre>

<pre>  15  The heathen are sunk in the pit
         which they themselves prepared;
      And in the net which they have hid
         their own feet fast are snared.</pre>

<pre>  16  The Lord is by the judgment known
         which he himself hath wrought:
      The sinners' hands do make the snares
         wherewith themselves are caught.</pre>

<pre>  17  They who are wicked into hell
         each one shall turned be;
      And all the nations that forget
         to seek the Lord most high. </pre>

<pre>  18  For they that needy are shall not
         forgotten be alway;
      The expectation of the poor
         shall not be lost for aye.</pre>

<pre>  19  Arise, Lord, let not man prevail;
         judge heathen in thy sight:
  20  That they may know themselves but men,
         the nations, Lord, affright</pre>
