A Prayer of the afflicted, when he is overwhelmed,<br>
and poureth out his complaint before the Lord.</em> </font></p>

  <pre>
     1  O Lord, unto my pray'r give ear,
           my cry let come to thee;
     2  And in the day of my distress
           hide not thy face from me.
  </pre>

   <pre>
      Give ear to me; what time I call,
         to answer me make haste:
         3  For, as an hearth, my bones are burnt,
         my days, like smoke, do waste.
   </pre>

  <pre>
     4  My heart within me smitten is,
           and it is withered
        Like very grass; so that I do
           forget to eat my bread.
  </pre>

  <pre>
     5  By reason of my groaning voice
           my bones cleave to my skin.
     6  Like pelican in wilderness
           forsaken I have been:
  </pre>

   <pre>
      I like an owl in desert am,
         that nightly there doth moan;
         7  I watch, and like a sparrow am
         on the house-top alone.
   </pre>

  <pre>
     8  My bitter en'mies all the day
           reproaches cast on me;
        And, being mad at me, with rage
           against me sworn they be.
  </pre>

  <pre>
     9  For why? I ashes eaten have
           like bread, in sorrows deep;
        My drink I also mingled have
           with tears that I did weep.
  </pre>

 <pre>
    10  Thy wrath and indignation
           did cause this grief and pain;
        For thou hast lift me up on high,
           and cast me down again.
 </pre>

 <pre>
    11  My days are like unto a shade,
           which doth declining pass;
        And I am dried and withered,
           ev'n like unto the grass.
 </pre>

 <pre>
    12  But thou, Lord, everlasting art,
           and thy remembrance shall
        Continually endure, and be
           to generations all.
 </pre>

 <pre>
    13  Thou shalt arise, and mercy have
           upon thy Zion yet;
        The time to favor her is come,
           the time that thou hast set.
 </pre>

 <pre>
    14  For in her rubbish and her stones
           thy servants pleasure take;
        Yea, they the very dust thereof
           do favor for her sake.
 </pre>

 <pre>
    15  So shall the heathen people fear
           the Lord's most holy name;
        And all the kings on earth shall dread
           thy glory and thy fame.
 </pre>

 <pre>
    16  When Zion by the mighty Lord
           built up again shall be,
        In glory then and majesty
           to men appear shall he.
 </pre>

 <pre>
    17  The prayer of the destitute
           he surely will regard;
        Their prayer will he not despise,
           by him it shall be heard.
 </pre>

 <pre>
    18  For generations yet to come
           this shall be on record:
        So shall the people that shall be
           created praise the Lord.
 </pre>

 <pre>
    19  He from his sanctuary's height
           hath downward cast his eye;
        And from his glorious throne in heav'n
           the Lord the earth did spy;
 </pre>

 <pre>
    20  That of the mournful prisoner
           the groanings he might hear,
        To set them free that unto death
           by men appointed are:
 </pre>

 <pre>
    21  That they in Zion may declare
           the Lord's most holy name,
        And publish in Jerusalem
           the praises of the same;
 </pre>

<pre>
   22   When as the people gather shall
             in troops with one accord,
        When kingdoms shall assembled be
             to serve the highest Lord.
</pre>

 <pre>
    23  My wonted strength and force he hath
           abated in the way,
        And he my days hath shortened:
    24      Thus therefore did I say,
 </pre>

<pre>
   My God, in mid-time of my days
      take thou me not away:
   From age to age eternally
      thy years endure and stay.
</pre>

 <pre>
    25  The firm foundation of the earth
           of old time thou hast laid;
        The heavens also are the work
           which thine own hands have made.
 </pre>

 <pre>
    26  Thou shalt for evermore endure,
           but they shall perish all;
        Yea, ev'ry one of them wax old,
           like to a garment, shall:
 </pre>

<pre>
   Thou, as a vesture, shalt them change,
      and they shall changed be:
   27  But thou the same art, and thy years
      are to eternity.
</pre>

 <pre>
    28  The children of thy servants shall
           continually endure;
        And in thy sight, O Lord, their seed
           shall be established sure.
 </pre>
