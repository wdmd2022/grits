 <pre>
        1  Not unto us, Lord, not to us,
              but do thou glory take
           Unto thy name, ev'n for thy truth,
              and for thy mercy's sake.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        2  O wherefore should the heathen say,
              Where is their God now gone?
        3  But our God in the heavens is,
              what pleased him he hath done.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        4  Their idols silver are and gold,
              work of men's hands they be.
        5  Mouths have they, but they do not speak;
              and eyes, but do not see;
 </pre>

 <pre>
        6  Ears have they, but they do not hear;
              noses, but savor not;
        7  Hands, feet, but handle not, nor walk;
              nor speak they through their throat.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        8  Like them their makers are, and all
              on them their trust that build.
        9  O Isr'el, trust thou in the Lord,
              he is their help and shield.
 </pre>

<pre>
       10  O Aaron's house, trust in the Lord,
              their help and shield is he.
       11  Ye that fear God, trust in the Lord,
              their help and shield he'll be.
</pre>

<pre>
       12  The Lord of us hath mindful been,
              and he will bless us still:
           He will the house of Isr'el bless,
              bless Aaron's house he will.
</pre>

<pre>
       13  Both small and great, that fear the Lord,
              he will them surely bless.
       14  The Lord will you, you and your seed,
              aye more and more increase.
</pre>

<pre>
       15  O bless-ed are ye of the Lord,
              who made the earth and heav'n.
       16  The heav'n, ev'n heav'ns, are God's, but he
              earth to men's sons hath giv'n.
</pre>

<pre>
       17  The dead, nor who to silence go,
              God's praise do not record.
       18  But henceforth we for ever will
              bless God. Praise ye the Lord.
</pre>
