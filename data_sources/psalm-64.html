<p><em><font FACE="Times New Roman">To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David. </font></em>  </p>

<pre>   1  When I to thee my prayer make,
         Lord, to my voice give ear;
      My life save from the enemy,
         of whom I stand in fear.</pre>

<pre>   2  Me from their secret counsel hide
         who do live wickedly;
      From insurrection of those men
         that work iniquity:</pre>

<pre>   3  Who do their tongues with malice whet,
         and make them cut like swords;
      In whose bent bows are arrows set,
         ev'n sharp and bitter words:</pre>

<pre>   4  That they may at the perfect man
         in secret aim their shot;
      Yea, suddenly they dare at him
         to shoot, and fear it not.</pre>

<pre>   5  In ill encourage they themselves,
         and their snares close do lay:
      Together conference they have;
         Who shall them see? they say.</pre>

<pre>   6  They have searched out iniquities,
         a perfect search they keep:
      Of each of them the inward thought,
         and very heart, is deep.</pre>

<pre>   7  God shall an arrow shoot at them,
         and wound them suddenly:
   8  So their own tongue shall them confound;
         all who them see shall fly.</pre>

<pre>   9  And on all men a fear shall fall,
         God's works they shall declare;
      For they shall wisely notice take
         what these his doings are.</pre>

<pre>  10  In God the righteous shall rejoice,
         and trust upon his might;
      Yea, they shall greatly glory all
         in heart that are upright.</pre>
