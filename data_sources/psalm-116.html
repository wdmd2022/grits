 <pre>
        1  I love the Lord, because my voice
              and prayers he did hear.
        2  I, while I live, will call on him,
              who bowed to me his ear.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        3  Of death the cords and sorrows did
              about me compass round;
           The pains of hell took hold on me,
              I grief and trouble found.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        4  Upon the name of God the Lord
              then did I call, and say,
           Deliver thou my soul, O Lord,
              I do thee humbly pray.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        5  God merciful and righteous is,
              yea, gracious is our Lord.
        6  God saves the meek: I was brought low,
              he did me help afford.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        7  O thou my soul, do thou return
              unto thy quiet rest;
           For largely, lo, the Lord to thee
              his bounty hath expressed.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        8  For my distressed soul from death
              delivered was by thee:
           Thou didst my mourning eyes from tears,
              my feet from falling, free.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        9  I in the land of those that live
              will walk the Lord before.
        10  I did believe, therefore I spake:
              I was afflicted sore.
 </pre>

<pre>
       11  I said, when I was in my haste,
              that all men liars be.
       12  What shall I render to the Lord
              for all his gifts to me?
</pre>

<pre>
       13  I'll of salvation take the cup,
              on God's name will I call:
       14  I'll pay my vows now to the Lord
              before his people all.
</pre>

<pre>
       15  Dear in God's sight is his saints' death.
       16     Thy servant, Lord, am I;
           Thy servant sure, thine handmaid's son:
              my bands thou didst untie.
</pre>

<pre>
       17  Thank off'rings I to thee will give,
              and on God's name will call.
       18  I'll pay my vows now to the Lord
              before his people all;
</pre>

<pre>
       19  Within the courts of God's own house,
              within the midst of thee,
           O city of Jerusalem.
              Praise to the Lord give ye.
</pre>
