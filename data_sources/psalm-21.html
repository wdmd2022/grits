<pre><em><font FACE="Times New Roman">To the chief Musician,
A Psalm of David. </font></em>  </pre>

<pre>   1  The king in thy great strength, O Lord,
         shall very joyful be:
      In thy salvation rejoice
         how veh'mently shall he!</pre>

<pre>   2  Thou hast bestowed upon him
         all that his heart would have;
      And thou from him didst not withhold
         whate'er his lips did crave.</pre>

<pre>   3  For thou with blessings him prevent'st
         of goodness manifold;
      And thou hast set upon his head
         a crown of purest gold.</pre>

<pre>   4  When he desired life of thee,
         thou life to him didst give;
      Ev'n such a length of days, that he
         for evermore should live.</pre>

<pre>   5  In that salvation wrought by thee
         his glory is made great;
      Honor and comely majesty
         thou hast upon him set.</pre>

<pre>   6  Because that thou for evermore
         most blessed hast him made;
      And thou hast with thy countenance
         made him exceeding glad.</pre>

<pre>   7  Because the king upon the Lord
         his confidence doth lay;
      And through the grace of the most High
         shall not be moved away.</pre>

<pre>   8  Thine hand shall all those men find out
         that en'mies are to thee;
      Ev'n thy right hand shall find out those
         of thee that haters be.</pre>

<pre>   9  Like fiery ov'n thou shalt them make,
         when kindled is thine ire;
      God shall them swallow in his wrath,
         devour them shall the fire.</pre>

<pre>  10  Their fruit from earth thou shalt destroy,
         their seed men from among:
  11  For they beyond their might 'gainst thee
         did plot mischief and wrong.</pre>

<pre>  12  Thou therefore shalt make them turn back,
         when thou thy shafts shalt place
      Upon thy strings, made ready all
         to fly against their face.</pre>

<pre>  13  In thy great pow'r and strength, O Lord,
         be thou exalted high;
      So shall we sing with joyful hearts,
         thy power praise shall we.</pre>
