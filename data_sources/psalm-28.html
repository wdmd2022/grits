<p><em>A Psalm of David.</em></p>

<pre>   1  To thee I'll cry, O Lord, my rock;
         hold not thy peace to me;
      Lest like those that to pit descend
         I by thy silence be.</pre>

<pre>   2  The voice hear of my humble pray'rs,
         when unto thee I cry;
      When to thine holy oracle
         I lift mine hands on high.</pre>

<pre>   3  With ill men draw me not away
         that work iniquity;
      That speak peace to their friends, while in
         their hearts doth mischief lie.</pre>

<pre>   4  Give them according to their deeds
         and ills endeavorèd:
      And as their handy-works deserve,
         to them be renderèd.</pre>

<pre>   5  God shall not build, but them destroy,
         who would not understand
      The Lord's own works, nor did regard
         the doing of his hand.</pre>

<pre>   6  For ever bless-ed be the Lord,
         for graciously he heard
      The voice of my petitions,
         and prayers did regard.</pre>

<pre>   7  The Lord's my strength and shield; my heart
         upon him did rely;
      And I am helpèd: hence my heart
         doth joy exceedingly,</pre>

<pre>      And with my song I will him praise.
   8     My strength is God alone:
      He also is the saving strength
         of his anointed one.</pre>

<pre>   9  O thine own people do thou save,
         bless thine inheritance;
      Them also do thou feed, and them
         for evermore advance.</pre>
