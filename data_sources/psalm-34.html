<blockquote>
  <p><font FACE="Times New Roman"><i>A Psalm</i> of David, when he changed his
  behavior
  before Abimelech; who drove him away, and he departed. </font></p>
</blockquote>

<pre>   1  God will I bless all times; his praise
         my mouth shall still express.
   2  My soul shall boast in God: the meek
         shall hear with joyfulness.</pre>

<pre>   3  Extol the Lord with me, let us
         exalt his name together.
   4  I sought the Lord, he heard, and did
         me from all fears deliver.</pre>

<pre>   5  They looked to him, and lightened were:
         not sham√®d were their faces.
   6  This poor man cried, God heard, and saved
         him from all his distresses.</pre>

<pre>   7  The angel of the Lord encamps,
         and round encompasseth
      All those about that do him fear,
         and them delivereth.</pre>

<pre>   8  O taste and see that God is good:
         who trusts in him is blessed.
   9  Fear God his saints: none that him fear
         shall be with want oppressed.</pre>

<pre>  10  The lions young may hungry be,
         and they may lack their food:
      But they that truly seek the Lord
         shall not lack any good.</pre>

<pre>  11  O children, hither do ye come,
         and unto me give ear;
      I shall you teach to understand
         how ye the Lord should fear.</pre>

<pre>  12  What man is he that life desires,
         to see good would live long?
  13  Thy lips refrain from speaking guile,
         and from ill words thy tongue.</pre>

<pre>  14  Depart from ill, do good, seek peace,
         pursue it earnestly.
  15  God's eyes are on the just; his ears
         are open to their cry.</pre>

<pre>  16  The face of God is set against
         those that do wickedly,
      That he may quite out from the earth
         cut off their memory.</pre>

<pre>  17  The righteous cry unto the Lord,
         he unto them gives ear;
      And they out of their troubles all
         by him delivered are.</pre>

<pre>  18  The Lord is ever nigh to them
         that be of broken sp'rit;
      To them he safety doth afford
         that are in heart contrite.</pre>

<pre>  19  The troubles that afflict the just
         in number many be;
      But yet at length out of them all
         the Lord doth set him free.</pre>

<pre>  20  He carefully his bones doth keep,
         whatever can befall;
      That not so much as one of them
         can broken be at all.</pre>

<pre>  21  Ill shall the wicked slay; laid waste
         shall be who hate the just.
  22  The Lord redeems his servants' souls;
         none perish that him trust.</pre>
