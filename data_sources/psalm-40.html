<pre>   1  I waited for the Lord my God,
         and patiently did bear;
      At length to me he did incline
         my voice and cry to hear.</pre>

<pre>   2  He took me from a fearful pit,
         and from the miry clay,
      And on a rock he set my feet,
         establishing my way.</pre>

<pre>   3  He put a new song in my mouth,
         our God to magnify:
      Many shall see it, and shall fear,
         and on the Lord rely.</pre>

<pre>   4  O blessed is the man whose trust
         upon the Lord relies;
      Respecting not the proud, nor such
         as turn aside to lies. </pre>

<pre>   5  O Lord my God, full many are
         the wonders thou hast done;
      Thy gracious thoughts to us-ward far
         above all thoughts are gone:</pre>

<pre>      In order none can reckon them
         to thee: if them declare,
      And speak of them I would, they more
         than can be numbered are.</pre>

<pre>   6  No sacrifice nor offering
         didst thou at all desire;
      Mine ears thou bored: sin-off 'ring thou
         and burnt didst not require:</pre>

<pre>   7  Then to the Lord these were my words,
         I come, behold and see;
      Within the volume of the book
         it written is of me:</pre>

<pre>   8  To do thy will I take delight,
         O thou my God that art;
      Yea, that most holy law of thine
         I have within my heart.</pre>

<pre>   9  Within the congregation great
         I righteousness did preach:
      Lo, thou dost know, O Lord, that I
         refrained not my speech.</pre>

<pre>  10  I never did within my heart
         conceal thy righteousness;
      I thy salvation have declared,
         and shown thy faithfulness:</pre>

<pre>      Thy kindness, which most loving is,
         concealed have not I,
      Nor from the congregation great
         have hid thy verity.</pre>

<pre>  11  Thy tender mercies, Lord, from me
         O do thou not restrain;
      Thy loving-kindness, and thy truth,
         let them me still maintain.</pre>

<pre>  12  For ills past reck'ning compass me,
         and mine iniquities
      Such hold upon me taken have,
         I cannot lift mine eyes:</pre>

<pre>      They more than hairs are on mine head,
         thence is my heart dismayed.
  13  Be pleased, Lord, to rescue me;
         Lord, hasten to mine aid.</pre>

<pre>  14  Shamed and confounded be they all
         that seek my soul to kill;
      Yea, let them backward driven be,
         and shamed, that wish me ill.</pre>

<pre>  15  For a reward of this their shame
         confounded let them be.
      That in this manner scoffing say,
         Aha, aha! to me.</pre>

<pre>  16  In thee let all be glad, and joy,
         who seeking thee abide;
      Who thy salvation love, say still,
         The Lord be magnified.</pre>

<pre>  17  I'm poor and needy, yet the Lord
         of me a care doth take:
      Thou art my help and savior,
         my God, no tarrying make.</pre>
