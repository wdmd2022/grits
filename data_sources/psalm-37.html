 <pre>
        1  For evil-doers fret thou not
              thyself unquietly;
           Nor do thou envy bear to those
              that work iniquity.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        2  For, even like unto the grass,
              soon be cut down shall they;
           And, like the green and tender herb,
              they wither shall away.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        3  Set thou thy trust upon the Lord,
              and be thou doing good;
           And so thou in the land shalt dwell,
              and verily have food.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        4  Delight thyself in God; he'll give
              thine heart's desire to thee.
        5  Thy way to God commit, him trust,
              it bring to pass shall he.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        6  And, like unto the light, he shall
              thy righteousness display;
           And he thy judgment shall bring forth
              like noon-tide of the day.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        7  Rest in the Lord, and patiently
              wait for him: do not fret
           For him who, prosp'ring in his way,
              success in sin doth get.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        8  Do thou from anger cease, and wrath
              see thou forsake also:
           Fret not thyself in any wise,
              that evil thou should'st do.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        9  For those that evil doers are
              shall be cut off and fall:
           But those that wait upon the Lord
              the earth inherit shall.
 </pre>

<pre>
       10  For yet a little while, and then
              the wicked shall not be;
           His place thou shalt consider well,
              but it thou shalt not see.
</pre>

<pre>
       11  But by inheritance the earth
              the meek ones shall possess:
           They also shall delight themselves
              in an abundant peace.
</pre>

<pre>
       12  The wicked plots against the just,
              and at him whets his teeth:
       13  The Lord shall laugh at him, because
              his day he coming seeth.
</pre>

<pre>
       14  The wicked have drawn out the sword,
              and bent their bow, to slay
           The poor and needy, and to kill
              men of an upright way.
</pre>

<pre>
       15  But their own sword, which they have drawn,
              shall enter their own heart:
           Their bows which they have bent shall break,
              and into pieces part.
</pre>

<pre>
       16  A little that a just man hath
              is more and better far
           Than is the wealth of many such
              as lewd and wicked are.
</pre>

<pre>
       17  For sinners' arms shall broken be;
              but God the just sustains.
       18  God knows the just man's days, and still
              their heritage remains.
</pre>

<pre>
       19  They shall not be ashamed when they
              the evil time do see;
           And when the days of famine are,
              they satisfied shall be.
</pre>

<pre>
       20  But wicked men, and foes of God,
              as fat of lambs, decay;
           They shall consume, yea, into smoke
              they shall consume away.
</pre>

<pre>
       21  The wicked borrows, but the same
              again he doth not pay;
           Whereas the righteous mercy shows,
              and gives his own away.
</pre>

<pre>
       22  For such as blessed be of him
              the earth inherit shall;
           And they that cursed are of him
              shall be destroyed all.
</pre>

<pre>
       23  A good man's footsteps by the Lord
              are ordered aright;
           And in the way wherein he walks
              he greatly doth delight.
</pre>

<pre>
       24  Although he fall, yet shall he not
              be cast down utterly;
           Because the Lord with his own hand
              upholds him mightily.
</pre>

<pre>
       25  I have been young, and now am old,
              yet have I never seen
           The just man left, nor that his seed
              for bread have beggars been.
</pre>

<pre>
       26  He's ever merciful, and lends:
              his seed is blessed therefore.
       27  Depart from evil, and do good,
              and dwell for evermore.
</pre>

<pre>
       28  For God loves judgment, and his saints
              leaves not in any case;
           They are kept ever: but cut off
              shall be the sinner's race.
</pre>

<pre>
       29  The just inherit shall the land,
              and ever in it dwell:
       30  The just man's mouth doth wisdom speak;
              his tongue doth judgment tell.
</pre>

<pre>
       31  In's heart the law is of his God,
              his steps slide not away.
       32  The wicked man doth watch the just,
              and seeketh him to slay.
</pre>

<pre>
       33  Yet him the Lord will not forsake,
              nor leave him in his hands:
           The righteous will he not condemn,
              when he in judgment stands.
</pre>

<pre>
       34  Wait on the Lord, and keep his way,
              and thee exalt shall he
           Th' earth to inherit; when cut off
              the wicked thou shalt see.
</pre>

<pre>
       35  I saw the wicked great in pow'r,
              spread like a green bay-tree:
       36  He passed, yea, was not; him I sought,
              but found he could not be.
</pre>

<pre>
       37  Mark thou the perfect, and behold
              the man of uprightness;
           Because that surely of this man
              the latter end is peace.
</pre>

<pre>
       38  But those men that transgressors are
              shall be destroyed together;
           The latter end of wicked men
              shall be cut off for ever.
</pre>

<pre>
       39  But the salvation of the just
              is from the Lord above;
           He in the time of their distress
              their stay and strength doth prove.
</pre>

<pre>
       40  The Lord shall help, and them deliver:
              he shall them free and save
           From wicked men; because in him
              their confidence they have.
