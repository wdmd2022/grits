  <pre>
          Aleph
          1  Blessed are they that undefiled,
                and straight are in the way;
             Who in the Lord's most holy law
                do walk, and do not stray.
  </pre>

  <pre>
          2   Blessed are they who to observe
                 his statutes are inclined;
              And who do seek the living God
                 with their whole heart and mind.
  </pre>

  <pre>
          3  Such in his ways do walk, and they
                do no iniquity.
          4  Thou hast commanded us to keep
                thy precepts carefully.
  </pre>

  <pre>
          5  O that thy statutes to observe
                thou would'st my ways direct!
          6  Then shall I not be shamed, when I
                thy precepts all respect.
  </pre>

  <pre>
          7  Then with integrity of heart
                thee will I praise and bless,
             When I the judgments all have learned
                of thy pure righteousness.
  </pre>

  <pre>
          8  That I will keep thy statutes all
                firmly resolved have I:
             O do not then, most gracious God,
                forsake me utterly.
  </pre>

  <pre>
          Beth
          9  By what means shall a young man learn
                his way to purify?
             If he according to thy word
                thereto attentive be.
  </pre>

 <pre>
         10  Unfeignedly thee have I sought
                with all my soul and heart:
             O let me not from the right path
                of thy commands depart.
 </pre>

 <pre>
         11  Thy word I in my heart have hid,
                that I offend not thee.
         12  O Lord, thou ever blessed art,
                thy statutes teach thou me.
 </pre>

 <pre>
         13  The judgments of thy mouth each one
                my lips declared have:
         14  More joy thy testimonies' way
                than riches all me gave.
 </pre>

 <pre>
         15  I will thy holy precepts make
                my meditation;
             And carefully I'll have respect
                unto thy ways each one.
 </pre>

 <pre>
         16  Upon thy statutes my delight
                shall constantly be set:
             And, by thy grace, I never will
                thy holy word forget.
 </pre>

<pre>
        Gimel

         17  With me thy servant, in thy grace,
                deal bountifully, Lord;
             That by thy favor I may live,
                and duly keep thy word.
</pre>

 <pre>
         18  Open mine eyes, that of thy law
                the wonders I may see.
         19  I am a stranger on this earth,
                hide not thy laws from me.
 </pre>

 <pre>
         20  My soul within me breaks, and doth
                much fainting still endure,
             Through longing that it hath all times
                unto thy judgments pure.
 </pre>

 <pre>
         21  Thou hast rebuked the cursed proud,
                who from thy precepts swerve.
         22  Reproach and shame remove from me,
                for I thy laws observe.
 </pre>

 <pre>
         23  Against me princes spake with spite,
                while they in council sat:
             But I thy servant did upon
                thy statutes meditate.
 </pre>

 <pre>
         24  My comfort, and my heart's delight,
                thy testimonies be;
             And they, in all my doubts and fears,
                are counselors to me
 </pre>

<pre>
        Daleth

         25  My soul to dust cleaves: quicken me,
                according to thy word.
         26  My ways I showed, and me thou heard'st:
                teach me thy statutes, Lord.
</pre>

 <pre>
         27  The way of thy commandements
                make me aright to know;
             So all thy works that wondrous are
                I shall to others show.
 </pre>

 <pre>
         28  My soul doth melt, and drop away,
                for heaviness and grief:
             To me, according to thy word,
                give strength, and send relief.
 </pre>

 <pre>
         29  From me the wicked way of lies
                let far removed be;
             And graciously thy holy law
                do thou grant unto me.
 </pre>

 <pre>
         30  I chosen have the perfect way
                of truth and verity:
             Thy judgments that most righteous are
                before me laid have I.
 </pre>

 <pre>
         31  I to thy testimonies cleave;
                shame do not on me cast.
         32   I'll run thy precepts' way, when thou
                my heart enlarged hast.
 </pre>

<pre>
        He

         33  Teach me, O Lord, the perfect way
                of thy precepts divine,
             And to observe it to the end
                I shall my heart incline.
</pre>

 <pre>
         34  Give understanding unto me,
                so keep thy law shall I;
             Yea, ev'n with my whole heart I shall
                observe it carefully.
 </pre>

 <pre>
         35  In thy law's path make me to go;
                for I delight therein.
         36  My heart unto thy testimonies,
                and not to greed, incline.
 </pre>

 <pre>
         37  Turn thou away my sight and eyes
                from viewing vanity;
             And in thy good and holy way
                be pleased to quicken me.
 </pre>

 <pre>
         38  Confirm to me thy gracious word,
                which I did gladly hear,
             Ev'n to thy servant, Lord, who is
                devoted to thy fear.
 </pre>

 <pre>
         39  Turn thou away my fear'd reproach;
                for good thy judgments be.
         40  Lo, for thy precepts I have long'd;
                in thy truth quicken me.
 </pre>

<pre>
        Vau

         41  Let thy sweet mercies also come
                and visit me, O Lord;
             Ev'n thy benign salvation,
                according to thy word.
</pre>

 <pre>
         42  So shall I have wherewith I may
                give him an answer just,
             Who spitefully reproacheth me;
                for in thy word I trust.
 </pre>

 <pre>
         43  The word of truth out of my mouth
                take thou not utterly;
             For on thy judgments righteous
                my hope doth still rely.
 </pre>

 <pre>
         44  So shall I keep for evermore
                thy law continually.
         45  And, sith that I thy precepts seek,
                I'll walk at liberty.
 </pre>

 <pre>
         46  I'll speak thy word to kings, and I
                with shame shall not be moved;
         47  And will delight myself always
                in thy laws, which I loved.
 </pre>

 <pre>
         48  To thy commandements, which I loved,
                my hands lift up I will;
             And I will also meditate
                upon thy statutes still
 </pre>

<pre>
        Zain

         49  Remember, Lord, thy gracious word
                thou to thy servant spake,
             Which, for a ground of my sure hope,
                thou causedst me to take.
</pre>

 <pre>
         50  This word of thine my comfort is
                in mine affliction:
             For in my straits I am revived
                by this thy word alone.
 </pre>

 <pre>
         51  The men whose hearts with pride are stuffed
                did greatly me deride;
             Yet from thy straight commandements
                I have not turned aside.
 </pre>

 <pre>
         52  Thy judgments righteous, O Lord,
                which thou of old forth gave,
             I did remember, and myself
                by them comforted have.
 </pre>

 <pre>
         53  Horror took hold on me, because
                ill men thy law forsake.
         54  I in my house of pilgrimage
                thy laws my songs do make.
 </pre>

 <pre>
         55  Thy name by night, Lord, I did mind,
                and I have kept thy law.
         56  And this I had, because thy word
                I kept, and stood in awe.
 </pre>

<pre>
        Cheth

         57  Thou my sure portion art alone,
                 which I did choose, O Lord:
             I have resolved, and said, that I
                would keep thy holy word.
</pre>

 <pre>
         58  With my whole heart I did entreat
                thy face and favor free:
             According to thy gracious word
                be merciful to me.
 </pre>

 <pre>
         59  I thought upon my former ways,
                and did my life well try;
             And to thy testimonies pure
                my feet then turned I.
 </pre>

 <pre>
         60  I did not stay, nor linger long,
                as those that slothful are;
             But hastily thy laws to keep
                myself I did prepare.
 </pre>

 <pre>
         61  Bands of ill men me robbed; yet I
                thy precepts did not slight.
         62  I'll rise at midnight thee to praise,
                ev'n for thy judgments right.
 </pre>

 <pre>
         63  I am companion to all those
                who fear, and thee obey.
         64  O Lord, thy mercy fills the earth:
                teach me thy laws, I pray.
 </pre>

<pre>
        Teth

         65  Well hast thou with thy servant dealt,
                as thou didst promise give.
         66  Good judgment me, and knowledge teach,
                for I thy word believe.
</pre>

 <pre>
         67  Ere I afflicted was I strayed;
                but now I keep thy word.
         68  Both good thou art, and good thou do'st:
                teach me thy statutes, Lord.
 </pre>

 <pre>
         69  The men that are puffed up with pride
                against me forged a lie;
             Yet thy commandements observe
               with my whole heart will I.
 </pre>

 <pre>
         70  Their hearts, through worldly ease and wealth,
                as fat as grease they be:
             But in thy holy law I take
                delight continually.
 </pre>

 <pre>
         71  It hath been very good for me
                that I afflicted was,
             That I might well instructed be,
                and learn thy holy laws.
 </pre>

 <pre>
         72  The word that cometh from thy mouth
                is better unto me
             Than many thousands and great sums
                of gold and silver be.
 </pre>

<pre>
        Jod

         73  Thou mad'st and fashion'dst me: thy laws
                to know give wisdom, Lord.
         74  So who thee fear shall joy to see
                me trusting in thy word.
</pre>

 <pre>
         75  That very right thy judgments are
                I know, and do confess;
             And that thou hast afflicted me
                in truth and faithfulness.
 </pre>

 <pre>
         76  O let thy kindness merciful,
                I pray thee, comfort me,
             As to thy servant faithfully
                was promised by thee.
 </pre>

 <pre>
         77  And let thy tender mercies come
                to me, that I may live;
             Because thy holy laws to me
                sweet delectation give.
 </pre>

 <pre>
         78  Lord, let the proud ashamed be;
                for they, without a cause,
             With me perversely dealt: but I
                will muse upon thy laws.
 </pre>

 <pre>
         79  Let such as fear thee, and have known
                thy statutes, turn to me.
         80  My heart let in thy laws be sound,
                that shamed I never be.
 </pre>

<pre>
        Caph

         81  My soul for thy salvation faints;
                yet I thy word believe.
         82  Mine eyes fail for thy word: I say,
                When wilt thou comfort give?
</pre>

 <pre>
         83  For like a bottle I'm become,
                that in the smoke is set:
             I'm black, and parched with grief; yet I
                thy statutes not forget.
 </pre>

 <pre>
         84  How many are thy servant's days?
                when wilt thou execute
             Just judgment on these wicked men
                that do me persecute?
 </pre>

 <pre>
         85  The proud have digged pits for me,
                which is against thy laws.
         86  Thy words all faithful are: help me,
                pursued without a cause.
 </pre>

 <pre>
         87  They so consumed me, that on earth
                my life they scarce did leave:
             Thy precepts yet forsook I not,
                but close to them did cleave.
 </pre>

 <pre>
         88  After thy loving-kindness, Lord,
                me quicken, and preserve:
             The testimony of thy mouth
                so shall I still observe.
 </pre>

<pre>
        Lamed

         89  Thy word for ever is, O Lord,
                in heaven settled fast;
         90  Unto all generations
                thy faithfulness doth last:
</pre>

     <pre>
             The earth thou hast established,
                and it abides by thee.
              91  This day they stand as thou ordain'dst;
                for all thy servants be.
     </pre>

 <pre>
         92  Unless in thy most perfect law
                my soul delights had found,
             I should have perished, when as
                my troubles did abound.
 </pre>

 <pre>
         93  Thy precepts I will ne'er forget;
                they quick'ning to me brought.
         94  Lord, I am thine; O save thou me:
                thy precepts I have sought.
 </pre>

 <pre>
         95  For me the wicked have laid wait,
                me seeking to destroy:
             But I thy testimonies true
                consider will with joy.
 </pre>

 <pre>
         96  An end of all perfection
                here have I seen, O God:
             But as for thy commandment,
                it is exceeding broad.
 </pre>

<pre>
        Mem

         97  O how love I thy law! it is
                my study all the day:
         98  It makes me wiser than my foes;
                for it doth with me stay.
</pre>

 <pre>
         99  Than all my teachers now I have
                more understanding far;
             Because my meditation
                thy testimonies are.
 </pre>

<pre>
        100  In understanding I excel
                those that are ancients;
             For I endeavored to keep
                all thy commandements.
</pre>

<pre>
        101  My feet from each ill way I stayed,
                that I may keep thy word.
        102  I from thy judgments have not swerved;
                for thou hast taught me, Lord.
</pre>

<pre>
        103   How sweet unto my taste, O Lord,
                  are all thy words of truth!
              Yea, I do find them sweeter far
                  than honey to my mouth.
</pre>

<pre>
        104  I through thy precepts, that are pure,
                do understanding get;
             I therefore ev'ry way that's false
                with all my heart do hate
</pre>

<pre>
        Nun

        105  Thy word is to my feet a lamp,
                and to my path a light.
        106  I sworn have, and I will perform,
                to keep thy judgments right.
</pre>

<pre>
        107  I am with sore affliction
                ev'n overwhelmed, O Lord:
             In mercy raise and quicken me,
                according to thy word.
</pre>

<pre>
        108  The free-will-off 'rings of my mouth
                accept, I thee beseech:
             And unto me thy servant, Lord,
                thy judgments clearly teach.
</pre>

<pre>
        109  Though still my soul be in my hand,
                thy laws I'll not forget.
        110  I erred not from them, though for me
                the wicked snares did set.
</pre>

<pre>
        111  I of thy testimonies have
                above all things made choice,
             To be my heritage for aye;
                for they my heart rejoice.
</pre>

<pre>
        112  I carefully inclined have
                my heart still to attend;
             That I thy statutes may perform
                alway unto the end.
</pre>

<pre>
        Samech

        113  I hate the thoughts of vanity,
                but love thy law do I.
        114  My shield and hiding-place thou art:
                I on thy word rely.
</pre>

<pre>
        115  All ye that evil-doers are
                from me depart away;
             For the commandements of my God
                I purpose to obey.
</pre>

<pre>
        116  According to thy faithful word
                uphold and stablish me,
             That I may live, and of my hope
                ashamed never be.
</pre>

<pre>
        117  Hold thou me up, so shall I be
                in peace and safety still;
             And to thy statutes have respect
                continually I will.
</pre>

<pre>
        118  Thou tread'st down all that love to stray;
                false their deceit doth prove.
        119  Lewd men, like dross, away thou putt'st;
                therefore thy law I love.
</pre>

<pre>
        120  For fear of thee my very flesh
                doth tremble, all dismayed;
             And of thy righteous judgments, Lord,
                my soul is much afraid.
</pre>

<pre>
        Ain

        121  To all men I have judgment done,
                performing justice right;
             Then let me not be left unto
                my fierce oppressors' might.
</pre>

<pre>
        122  For good unto thy servant, Lord,
                thy servant's surety be:
             From the oppression of the proud
                do thou deliver me.
</pre>

<pre>
        123  Mine eyes do fail with looking long
                for thy salvation,
             The word of thy pure righteousness
                while I do wait upon.
</pre>

<pre>
        124  In mercy with thy servant deal,
                thy laws me teach and show.
        125  I am thy servant, wisdom give,
                that I thy laws may know.
</pre>

<pre>
        126  'Tis time thou work, Lord; for they have
                made void thy law divine.
        127  Therefore thy precepts more I love
                than gold, yea, gold most fine.
</pre>

<pre>
        128  Concerning all things thy commands
                all right I judge therefore;
             And ev'ry false and wicked way
                I perfectly abhor.
</pre>

<pre>
        Pe

        129  Thy statutes, Lord, are wonderful,
                my soul them keeps with care.
        130  The entrance of thy words gives light,
                makes wise who simple are.
</pre>

<pre>
        131  My mouth I have wide opened,
                and panted earnestly,
             While after thy commandements
                I longed exceedingly.
</pre>

<pre>
        132  Look on me, Lord, and merciful
                do thou unto me prove,
             As thou art wont to do to those
                thy name who truly love.
</pre>

<pre>
        133  O let my footsteps in thy word
                aright still ordered be:
              Let no iniquity obtain
                 dominion over me.
</pre>

<pre>
        134  From man's oppression save thou me;
                so keep thy laws I will.
        135  Thy face make on thy servant shine;
                teach me thy statutes still.
</pre>

<pre>
        136  Rivers of waters from mine eyes
                did run down, when I saw
             How wicked men run on in sin,
                and do not keep thy law.
</pre>

<pre>
        Tzaddi

        137  O Lord, thou art most righteous;
                thy judgments are upright.
        138  Thy testimonies thou command'st
                most faithful are and right.
</pre>

<pre>
        139  My zeal hath ev'n consumed me,
                because mine enemies
             Thy holy words forgotten have,
                and do thy laws despise.
</pre>

<pre>
        140  Thy word's most pure, therefore on it
                thy servant's love is set.
        141  Small, and despised I am, yet I
                thy precepts not forget.
</pre>

<pre>
        142  Thy righteousness is righteousness
                which ever doth endure:
             Thy holy law, Lord, also is
                the very truth most pure.
</pre>

<pre>
        143  Trouble and anguish have me found,
                and taken hold on me:
             Yet in my trouble my delight
                thy just commandements be.
</pre>

<pre>
        144  Eternal righteousness is in
                thy testimonies all:
             Lord, to me understanding give,
                and ever live I shall.
</pre>

<pre>
        Koph

        145  With my whole heart I cried, Lord, hear;
                I will thy word obey.
        146  I cried to thee; save me, and I
                will keep thy laws alway.
</pre>

<pre>
        147  I of the morning did prevent
                the dawning, and did cry:
             For all mine expectation
                did on thy word rely.
</pre>

<pre>
        148  Mine eyes did timeously prevent
                the watches of the night,
             That in thy word with careful mind
                then meditate I might.
</pre>

<pre>
        149  After thy loving-kindness hear
                my voice, that calls on thee:
             According to thy judgment, Lord,
                revive and quicken me.
</pre>

<pre>
        150  Who follow mischief they draw nigh;
                they from thy law are far:
        151  But thou art near, Lord; most firm truth
                all thy commandements are.
</pre>

<pre>
        152  As for thy testimonies all,
                of old this have I tried,
             That thou hast surely founded them
                for ever to abide.
</pre>

<pre>
        Resh

        153  Consider mine affliction,
                in safety do me set:
             Deliver me, O Lord, for I
                thy law do not forget.
</pre>

<pre>
        154  After thy word revive thou me:
                save me, and plead my cause.
        155  Salvation is from sinners far;
                for they seek not thy laws.
</pre>

<pre>
        156  O Lord, both great and manifold
                thy tender mercies be:
             According to thy judgments just,
                revive and quicken me.
</pre>

<pre>
        157  My persecutors many are,
                and foes that do combine;
             Yet from thy testimonies pure
                my heart doth not decline.
</pre>

<pre>
        158  I saw transgressors, and was grieved;
                for they keep not thy word.
        159  See how I love thy law! as thou
                art kind, me quicken, Lord.
</pre>

<pre>
        160  From the beginning all thy word
                hath been most true and sure:
             Thy righteous judgments ev'ry one
                for evermore endure.
</pre>

<pre>
        Schin

        161  Princes have persecuted me,
                although no cause they saw:
             But still of thy most holy word
                my heart doth stand in awe.
</pre>

<pre>
        162  I at thy word rejoice, as one
                of spoil that finds great store.
        163  Thy law I love; but lying all
                I hate and do abhor.
</pre>

<pre>
        164  Sev'n times a-day it is my care
                to give due praise to thee;
             Because of all thy judgments, Lord,
                which righteous ever be.
</pre>

<pre>
        165  Great peace have they who love thy law;
                offence they shall have none.
        166  I hoped for thy salvation, Lord,
                and thy commands have done.
</pre>

<pre>
        167  My soul thy testimonies pure
                observ-ed carefully;
             On them my heart is set, and them
                I love exceedingly.
</pre>

<pre>
        168  Thy testimonies and thy laws
                I kept with special care;
             For all my works and ways each one
                before thee open are.
</pre>

<pre>
        Tau

        169  O let my earnest pray'r and cry
                come near before thee, Lord:
             Give understanding unto me,
                according to thy word.
</pre>

<pre>
        170  Let my request before thee come:
                after thy word me free.
        171  My lips shall utter praise, when thou
                hast taught thy laws to me.
</pre>

<pre>
        172  My tongue of thy most blessed word
                shall speak, and it confess;
             Because all thy commandements
                are perfect righteousness.
</pre>

<pre>
        173  Let thy strong hand make help to me:
                thy precepts are my choice.
        174  I longed for thy salvation, Lord,
                and in thy law rejoice.
</pre>

<pre>
        175  O let my soul live, and it shall
                give praises unto thee;
             And let thy judgments gracious
                be helpful unto me.
</pre>

<pre>
        176  I, like a lost sheep, went astray;
                thy servant seek, and find:
             For thy commands I suffered not
                to slip out of my mind.
