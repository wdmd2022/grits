<blockquote>
  <p><em><font FACE="Times New Roman">To the chief Musician, Al-taschith, Michtam of David. </font></em></p>
</blockquote>

<pre>   1  Do ye, O congregation,
         indeed speak righteousness?
      O ye that are the sons of men,
         judge ye with uprightness?</pre>

<pre>   2  Yea, ev'n within your very hearts
         ye wickedness have done;
      And ye the vi'lence of your hands
         do weigh the earth upon.</pre>

<pre>   3  The wicked men estranged are,
         ev'n from the very womb;
      They, speaking lies, do stray as soon
         as to the world they come.</pre>

<pre>   4  Unto a serpent's poison like
         their poison doth appear;
      Yea, they are like the adder deaf,
         that closely stops her ear;</pre>

<pre>   5  That so she may not hear the voice
         of one that charm her would,
      No, not though he most cunning were,
         and charm most wisely could.</pre>

<pre>   6  Their teeth, O God, within their mouth
         break thou in pieces small;
      The great teeth break thou out, O Lord,
         of these young lions all.</pre>

<pre>   7  Let them like waters melt away,
         which downward still do flow:
      In pieces cut his arrows all,
         when he shall bend his bow.</pre>

<pre>   8  Like to a snail that melts away,
         let each of them be gone;
      Like woman's birth untimely, that
         they never see the sun.</pre>

<pre>   9  He shall them take away before
         your pots the thorns can find,
      Both living, and in fury great,
         as with a stormy wind.</pre>

<pre>  10  The righteous, when he vengeance sees,
         he shall be joyful then;
      The righteous one shall wash his feet
         in blood of wicked men.</pre>

<pre>  11  So men shall say, The righteous man
         reward shall never miss:
      And verily upon the earth
         a God to judge there is.</pre>
