<pre>   1  The mighty God, the Lord, hath spoke,
         and called the earth upon,
      Ev'n from the rising of the sun
         unto his going down.</pre>

<pre>   2  From out of Zion, his own hill,
         where the perfection high
      Of beauty is, from thence the Lord
         hath shined gloriously.</pre>

<pre>   3  Our God shall come, and shall no more
         be silent, but speak out:
      Before him fire shall waste, great storms
         shall compass him about.</pre>

<pre>   4  He to the heavens from above,
         and to the earth below,
      Shall call, that he his judgments may
         before his people show.</pre>

<pre>   5  Let all my saints together be
         unto me gathered;
      Those that by sacrifice with me
         a covenant have made.</pre>

<pre>   6  And then the heavens shall declare
         his righteousness abroad:
      Because the Lord himself doth come;
         none else is judge but God.</pre>

<pre>   7  Hear, O my people, and I'll speak;
         O Israel by name,
      Against thee I will testify;
         God, ev'n thy God, I am.</pre>

<pre>   8  I for thy sacrifices few
         reprove thee never will,
      Nor for burnt-off 'rings to have been
         before me offered still.</pre>

<pre>   9  I'll take no bullock nor he-goats
         from house nor folds of thine:
  10  For beasts of forests, cattle all
         on thousand hills, are mine.</pre>

<pre>  11  The fowls are all to me well known
         that mountains high do yield;
      And I do challenge as mine own
         the wild beasts of the field.</pre>

<pre>  12  If I were hungry, I would not
         to thee for need complain;
      For earth, and all its fullness, doth
         to me of right pertain.</pre>

<pre>  13  That I to eat the flesh of bulls
         take pleasure dost thou think?
      Or that I need, to quench my thirst,
         the blood of goats to drink?</pre>

<pre>  14  Nay, rather unto me, thy God,
         thanksgiving offer thou:
      To the most High perform thy word,
         and fully pay thy vow:</pre>

<pre>  15  And in the day of trouble great
         see that thou call on me;
      I will deliver thee, and thou
         my name shalt glorify.</pre>

<pre>  16  But God unto the wicked saith,
         Why should'st thou mention make
      Of my commands? how dar'st thou in
         thy mouth my cov'nant take?</pre>

<pre>  17  Since it is so that thou dost hate
         all good instruction;
      And since thou cast'st behind thy back,
         and slight'st my words each one.</pre>

<pre>  18  When thou a thief didst see, then straight
         thou join'dst with him in sin,
      And with the vile adulterers
         thou hast partaker been.</pre>

<pre>  19  Thy mouth to evil thou dost give,
         thy tongue deceit doth frame.
  20  Thou sitt'st, and 'gainst thy brother speak'st,
         thy mother's son to shame.</pre>

<pre>  21  These things thou wickedly hast done,
         and I have silent been:
      Thou thought'st that I was like thyself,
         and did approve thy sin:</pre>

<pre>      But I will sharply thee reprove,
         and I will order right
      Thy sins and thy transgressions
         in presence of thy sight.</pre>

<pre>  22  Consider this, and be afraid,
         ye that forget the Lord,
      Lest I in pieces tear you all,
         when none can help afford.</pre>

<pre>  23  Who off'reth praise me glorifies:
         I will shew God's salvation
      To him that ordereth aright
         his life and conversation.</pre>
