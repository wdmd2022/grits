<p><em>To the chief Musician,<br>
A Psalm of David</em></p>

 <pre>
    1  O thou the God of all my praise,
          do thou not hold thy peace;
    2  For mouths of wicked men to speak
          against me do not cease:
 </pre>

    <pre>
       The mouths of vile deceitful men
          against me opened be;
       And with a false and lying tongue
          they have accus-ed me.
    </pre>

 <pre>
    3  They did beset me round about
          with words of hateful spite:
       And though to them no cause I gave,
           against me they did fight.
 </pre>

 <pre>
    4  They for my love became my foes,
          but I me set to pray.
    5  Evil for good, hatred for love,
          to me they did repay.
 </pre>

 <pre>
    6  Set thou the wicked over him;
          and upon his right hand
       Give thou his greatest enemy,
          ev'n Satan, leave to stand.
 </pre>

 <pre>
    7  And when by thee he shall be judged,
          let him condemn-ed be;
       And let his pray'r be turn'd to sin,
          when he shall call on thee.
 </pre>

 <pre>
    8  Few be his days, and in his room
          his charge another take.
    9  His children let be fatherless,
          his wife a widow make.
 </pre>

<pre>
   10  His children let be vagabonds,
          and beg continually;
       And from their places desolate
          seek bread for their supply.
</pre>

<pre>
   11  Let covetous extortioners
          catch all he hath away:
       Of all for which he laboured hath
          let strangers make a prey.
</pre>

<pre>
   12  Let there be none to pity him,
          let there be none at all
       That on his children fatherless
          will let his mercy fall.
</pre>

<pre>
   13  Let his posterity from earth
          cut off for ever be,
       And in the foll'wing age their name
          be blotted out by thee.
</pre>

<pre>
   14  Let God his father's wickedness
          still to remembrance call;
       And never let his mother's sin
          be blotted out at all.
</pre>

<pre>
   15  But let them all before the Lord
          appear continually,
       That he may wholly from the earth
          cut off their memory.
</pre>

<pre>
   16  Because he mercy minded not,
          but persecuted still
       The poor and needy, that he might
          the broken-hearted kill.
</pre>

<pre>
   17  As he in cursing pleasure took,
          so let it to him fall;
       As he delighted not to bless,
          so bless him not at all.
</pre>

<pre>
   18  As cursing he like clothes put on,
          into his bowels so,
       Like water, and into his bones,
          like oil, down let it go.
</pre>

<pre>
   19  Like to the garment let it be
          which doth himself array,
       And for a girdle, wherewith he
          is girt about alway.
</pre>

<pre>
   20  From God let this be their reward
          that en'mies are to me,
       And their reward that speak against
          my soul maliciously.
</pre>

<pre>
   21  But do thou, for thine own name's sake,
          O God the Lord, for me:
       Sith good and sweet thy mercy is,
          from trouble set me free.
</pre>

<pre>
   22  For I am poor and indigent,
          afflicted sore am I,
       My heart within me also is
          wounded exceedingly.
</pre>

<pre>
   23  I pass like a declining shade,
          am like the locust tossed:
   24  My knees through fasting weakened are,
          my flesh hath fatness lost.
</pre>

<pre>
   25  I also am a vile reproach
          unto them made to be;
       And they that did upon me look
          did shake their heads at me.
</pre>

<pre>
   26  O do thou help and succour me,
          who art my God and Lord:
       And, for thy tender mercy's sake,
          safety to me afford:
</pre>

<pre>
   27  That thereby they may know that this
          is thy almighty hand;
       And that thou, Lord, hast done the same,
          they may well understand.
</pre>

<pre>
   28  Although they curse with spite, yet, Lord,
          bless thou with loving voice:
       Let them ashamed be when they rise;
          thy servant let rejoice.
</pre>

<pre>
   29  Let thou mine adversaries all
          with shame be cloth-ed over;
       And let their own confusion
          them, as a mantle, cover.
</pre>

<pre>
   30  But as for me, I with my mouth
          will greatly praise the Lord;
       And I among the multitude
          his praises will record.
</pre>

<pre>
   31  For he shall stand at his right hand
          who is in poverty,
       To save him from all those that would
          condemn his soul to die.
</pre>
