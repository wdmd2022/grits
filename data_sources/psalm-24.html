<pre>   1  The earth belongs unto the Lord,
         and all that it contains;
      The world that is inhabited,
         and all that there remains.</pre>

<pre>   2  For the foundations thereof
         he on the seas did lay,
      And he hath it established
         upon the floods to stay.</pre>

<pre>   3  Who is the man that shall ascend
         into the hill of God?
      Or who within his holy place
         shall have a firm abode?</pre>

<pre>   4  Whose hands are clean, whose heart is pure,
         and unto vanity
      Who hath not lifted up his soul,
         nor sworn deceitfully.</pre>

<pre>   5  He from th' Eternal shall receive
         the blessing him upon,
      And righteousness, ev'n from the God
         of his salvation.</pre>

<pre>   6  This is the generation
         that after him enquire,
      O Jacob, who do seek thy face
         with their whole heart's desire.</pre>

<pre>   7  Ye gates, lift up your heads on high;
         ye doors that last for aye,
      Be lifted up, that so the King
         of glory enter may.</pre>

<pre>   8  But who of glory is the King?
         The mighty Lord is this;
      Ev'n that same Lord, that great in might
         and strong in battle is.</pre>

<pre>   9  Ye gates, lift up your heads; ye doors,
         doors that do last for aye,
      Be lifted up, that so the King
         of glory enter may.</pre>

<pre>  10  But who is he that is the King
         of glory? who is this?
      The Lord of hosts, and none but he,
         the King of glory is.</pre>
