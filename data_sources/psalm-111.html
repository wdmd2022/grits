 <pre>
       1  Praise ye the Lord: with my whole heart
             I will God's praise declare,
          Where the assemblies of the just
             and congregations are.
 </pre>

 <pre>
       2  The whole works of the Lord our God
             are great above all measure,
          Sought out they are of ev'ry one
             that doth therein take pleasure.
 </pre>

 <pre>
       3  His work most honourable is,
             most glorious and pure,
          And his untainted righteousness
             for ever doth endure.
 </pre>

 <pre>
       4  His works most wonderful he hath
             made to be thought upon:
          The Lord is gracious, and he is
             full of compassion.
 </pre>

 <pre>
       5  He giveth meat unto all those
             that truly do him fear;
          And evermore his covenant
             he in his mind will bear.
 </pre>

 <pre>
       6  He did the power of his works
             unto his people show,
          When he the heathen's heritage
             upon them did bestow.
 </pre>

 <pre>
       7  His handy-works are truth and right;
             all his commands are sure:
       8  And, done in truth and uprightness,
             they evermore endure.
 </pre>

 <pre>
       9  He sent redemption to his folk;
             his covenant for aye
          He did command: holy his name
             and rev'rend is alway.
 </pre>

<pre>
      10  Wisdom's beginning is God's fear:
             good understanding they
          Have all that his commands fulfill:
             his praise endures for aye.
