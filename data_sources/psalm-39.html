<pre>
   1  I said, I will look to my ways,
           lest with my tongue I sin:
        In sight of wicked men my mouth
            with bridle I'll keep in.
</pre>

  <pre>
     2  With silence I as dumb became,
           I did myself restrain
        From speaking good; but then the more
           increased was my pain.
  </pre>

  <pre>
     3  My heart within me waxed hot;
           and, while I musing was,
        The fire did burn; and from my tongue
           these words I did let pass:
  </pre>

  <pre>
     4  Mine end, and measure of my days,
           O Lord, unto me show
        What is the same; that I thereby
           my frailty well may know.
  </pre>

  <pre>
     5  Lo, thou my days an handbreadth mad'st;
           mine age is in thine eye
        As nothing: sure each man at best
           is wholly vanity.
  </pre>

  <pre>
     6  Sure each man walks in a vain show;
           they vex themselves in vain:
        He heaps up wealth, and doth not know
           to whom it shall pertain.
  </pre>

  <pre>
     7  And now, O Lord, what wait I for?
           my hope is fix'd on thee.
     8  Free me from all my trespasses,
           the fool's scorn make not me.
  </pre>

  <pre>
     9  Dumb was I, op'ning not my mouth,
          because this work was thine.
      10  Thy stroke take from me; by the blow
           of thine hand I do pine.
  </pre>

 <pre>
    11  When with rebukes thou dost correct
           man for iniquity,
        Thou wastes his beauty like a moth:
           sure each man's vanity.
 </pre>

 <pre>
    12  Attend my cry, Lord, at my tears
           and pray'rs not silent be:
        I sojourn as my fathers all,
           and stranger am with thee.
 </pre>

 <pre>
    13  O spare thou me, that I my strength
           recover may again,
        Before from hence I do depart,
           and here no more remain.
 </pre>
