  <pre>
         1  Praise ye the Lord; for it is good
               praise to our God to sing:
            For it is pleasant, and to praise
               it is a comely thing.
  </pre>

  <pre>
         2  God doth build up Jerusalem;
               and he it is alone
            That the dispersed of Israel
               doth gather into one.
  </pre>

  <pre>
         3  Those that are broken in their heart,
               and griev√®d in their minds,
            He healeth, and their painful wounds
               he tenderly up-binds.
  </pre>

  <pre>
         4  He counts the number of the stars;
               he names them ev'ry one.
         5  Great is our Lord, and of great pow'r;
               his wisdom search can none.
  </pre>

  <pre>
         6  The Lord lifts up the meek; and casts
               the wicked to the ground.
         7  Sing to the Lord, and give him thanks;
               on harp his praises sound;
  </pre>

  <pre>
         8  Who covereth the heav'n with clouds,
               who for the earth below
            Prepareth rain, who maketh grass
               upon the mountains grow.
  </pre>

  <pre>
         9  He gives the beast his food, he feeds
               the ravens young that cry.
          10  His pleasure not in horses' strength,
               nor in man's legs, doth lie.
  </pre>

 <pre>
        11  But in all those that do him fear
               the Lord doth pleasure take;
            In those that to his mercy do
               by hope themselves betake.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        12  The Lord praise, O Jerusalem;
               Zion, thy God confess:
        13  For thy gates' bars he maketh strong;
               thy sons in thee doth bless.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        14  He in thy borders maketh peace;
               with fine wheat filleth thee.
        15  He sends forth his command on earth,
               his word runs speedily.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        16  Hoar-frost, like ashes, scatt'reth he;
               like wool he snow doth give:
        17  Like morsels casteth forth his ice;
               who in its cold can live?
 </pre>

 <pre>
        18  He sendeth forth his mighty word,
               and melteth them again;
            His wind he makes to blow, and then
               the waters flow amain.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        19  The doctrine of his holy word
               to Jacob he doth show;
            His statutes and his judgments he
               gives Israel to know.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        20  To any nation never he
               such favor did afford;
            For they his judgments have not known.
               O do ye praise the Lord.
 </pre>
