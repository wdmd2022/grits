<pre>   1  My God, deliver me from those
         that are mine enemies;
      And do thou me defend from those
         that up against me rise.</pre>

<pre>   2  Do thou deliver me from them
         that work iniquity;
      And give me safety from the men
         of bloody cruelty.</pre>

<pre>   3  For, lo, they for my soul lay wait:
         the mighty do combine
      Against me, Lord; not for my fault,
         nor any sin of mine.</pre>

<pre>   4  They run, and, without fault in me,
         themselves do ready make:
      Awake to meet me with thy help;
         and do thou notice take.</pre>

<pre>   5  Awake therefore, Lord God of hosts,
         thou God of Israel,
      To visit heathen all: spare none
         that wickedly rebel.</pre>

<pre>   6  At ev'ning they go to and fro;
         they make great noise and sound,
      Like to a dog, and often walk
         about the city round.</pre>

<pre>   7  Behold, they belch out with their mouth,
         and in their lips are swords:
      For they do say thus, Who is he
         that now doth hear our words?</pre>

<pre>   8  But thou, O Lord, shalt laugh at them,
         and all the heathen mock.
   9  While he's in pow'r I'll wait on thee;
         for God is my high rock.</pre>

<pre>  10  He of my mercy that is God
         betimes shall me prevent;
      Upon mine en'mies God shall let
         me see mine heart's content.</pre>

<pre>  11  Them slay not, lest my folk forget;
         but scatter them abroad
      By thy strong pow'r; and bring them down,
         O thou our shield and God.</pre>

<pre>  12  For their mouth's sin, and for the words
         that from their lips do fly,
      Let them be taken in their pride;
         because they curse and lie.</pre>

<pre>  13  In wrath consume them, them consume,
         that so they may not be:
      And that in Jacob God doth rule
         to th' earth's ends let them see.</pre>

<pre>  14  At ev'ning let thou them return,
         making great noise and sound,
      Like to a dog, and often walk
         about the city round.</pre>

<pre>  15  And let them wander up and down,
         in seeking food to eat;
      And let them grudge when they shall not
         be satisfied with meat.</pre>

<pre>  16  But of thy pow'r I'll sing aloud;
         at morn thy mercy praise:
      For thou to me my refuge wast,
         and tow'r, in troublous days.</pre>

<pre>  17  O God, thou art my strength, I will
         sing praises unto thee;
      For God is my defense, a God
         of mercy unto me.</pre>
