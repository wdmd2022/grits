<pre>   1  God's mercies I will ever sing;
         and with my mouth I shall
      Thy faithfulness make to be known
         to generations all.</pre>

<pre>   2  For mercy shall be built, said I,
         for ever to endure;
      Thy faithfulness, ev'n in the heav'ns,
         thou wilt establish sure.</pre>

<pre>   3  I with my chosen One have made
         a cov'nant graciously;
      And to my servant, whom I loved,
         to David sworn have I;</pre>

<pre>   4  That I thy seed establish shall
         for ever to remain,
      And will to generations all
         thy throne build and maintain.</pre>

<pre>   5  The praises of thy wonders, Lord,
         the heavens shall express;
      And in the congregation
         of saints thy faithfulness.</pre>

<pre>   6  For who in heaven with the Lord
         may once himself compare?
      Who is like God among the sons
         of those that mighty are?</pre>

<pre>   7  Great fear in meeting of the saints
         is due unto the Lord;
      And he of all about him should
         with rev'rence be adored.</pre>

<pre>   8  O thou that art the Lord of hosts,
         what Lord in mightiness
      Is like to thee? who compassed round
         art with thy faithfulness.</pre>

<pre>   9  Ev'n in the raging of the sea
         thou over it dost reign;
      And when the waves thereof do swell,
         thou stillest them again.</pre>

<pre>  10  Rahab in pieces thou didst break,
         like one that slaughtered is;
      And with thy mighty arm thou hast
         dispersed thine enemies.</pre>

<pre>  11  The heav'ns are thine, thou for thine own
         the earth dost also take;
      The world, and fulness of the same,
         thy pow'r did found and make.</pre>

<pre>  12  The north and south from thee alone
         their first beginning had;
      Both Tabor mount and Hermon hill
         shall in thy name be glad.</pre>

<pre>  13  Thou hast an arm that's full of pow'r,
         thy hand is great in might;
      And thy right hand exceedingly
         exalted is in height.</pre>

<pre>  14  Justice and judgment of thy throne
         are made the dwelling-place;
      Mercy, accompanied with truth,
         shall go before thy face.</pre>

<pre>  15  O greatly blessed the people are
         the joyful sound that know;
      In brightness of thy face, O Lord,
         they ever on shall go.</pre>

<pre>  16  They in thy name shall all the day
         rejoice exceedingly;
      And in thy righteousness shall they
         exalted be on high.</pre>

<pre>  17  Because the glory of their strength
         doth only stand in thee;
      And in thy favor shall our horn
         and pow'r exalted be.</pre>

<pre>  18  For God is our defense; and he
         to us doth safety bring:
      The Holy One of Israel
         is our almighty King.</pre>

<pre>  19  In vision to thy Holy One
         thou saidst, I help upon
      A strong one laid; out of the folk
         I raised a chosen one;</pre>

<pre>  20  Ev'n David, I have found him out
         a servant unto me;
      And with my holy oil my King
         anointed him to be.</pre>

<pre>  21  With whom my hand shall stablished be;
         mine arm shall make him strong.
  22  On him the foe shall not exact,
         nor son of mischief wrong.</pre>

<pre>  23  I will beat down before his face
         all his malicious foes;
      I will them greatly plague who do
         with hatred him oppose.</pre>

<pre>  24  My mercy and my faithfulness
         with him yet still shall be;
      And in my name his horn and pow'r
         men shall exalted see.</pre>

<pre>  25  His hand and pow'r shall reach afar;
         I'll set it in the sea;
      And his right hand established
         shall in the rivers be.</pre>

<pre>  26  Thou art my Father, he shall cry,
         thou art my God alone;
      And he shall say, Thou art the Rock
         of my salvation.</pre>

<pre>  27  I'll make him my first-born, more high
         than kings of any land.
  28  My love I'll ever keep for him,
         my cov'nant fast shall stand.</pre>

<pre>  29  His seed I by my pow'r will make
         for ever to endure;
      And, as the days of heav'n, his throne
         shall stable be, and sure.</pre>

<pre>  30  But if his children shall forsake
         my laws, and go astray,
      And in my judgments shall not walk,
         but wander from my way:</pre>

<pre>  31  If they my laws break, and do not
         keep my commandements;
  32  I'll visit then their faults with rods,
         their sins with chastisements.</pre>

<pre>  33  Yet I'll not take my love from him,
         nor false my promise make.
  34  My cov'nant I'll not break, nor change
         what with my mouth I spake.</pre>

<pre>  35  Once by my holiness I sware,
         to David I'll not lie;
  36  His seed and throne shall, as the sun,
         before me last for aye.</pre>

<pre>  37  It, like the moon, shall ever be
         established stedfastly;
      And like to that which in the heav'n
         doth witness faithfully.</pre>

<pre>  38  But thou, displeased, hast cast off,
         thou didst abhor and loathe;
      With him that thine anointed is
         thou hast been very wroth.</pre>

<pre>  39  Thou hast thy servant's covenant
         made void, and quite cast by;
      Thou hast profaned his crown, while it
         cast on the ground doth lie.</pre>

<pre>  40  Thou all his hedges hast broke down,
         his strong holds down hast torn.
  41  He to all passers-by a spoil,
         to neighbors is a scorn.</pre>

<pre>  42  Thou hast set up his foes' right hand;
         mad'st all his en'mies glad:
  43  Turned his sword's edge, and him to stand
         in battle hast not made.</pre>

<pre>  44  His glory thou hast made to cease,
         his throne to ground down cast;
  45  Shortened his days of youth, and him
         with shame thou covered hast.</pre>

<pre>  46  How long, Lord, wilt thou hide thyself?
         for ever, in thine ire?
      And shall thine indignation
         burn like unto a fire?</pre>

<pre>  47  Remember, Lord, how short a time
         I shall on earth remain:
      O wherefore is it so that thou
         has made all men in vain?</pre>

<pre>  48  What man is he that liveth here,
         and death shall never see?
      Or from the power of the grave
         what man his soul shall free?</pre>

<pre>  49  Thy former loving-kindnesses,
         O Lord, where be they now?
      Those which in truth and faithfulness
         to David sworn hast thou?</pre>

<pre>  50  Mind, Lord, thy servant's sad reproach;
         how I in bosom bear
      The scornings of the people all,
         who strong and mighty are.</pre>

<pre>  51  Wherewith thy raging enemies
         reproached, O Lord, think on;
    Wherewith they have reproached the steps
       of thine anointed one.</pre>

<pre>  52  All blessing to the Lord our God
         let be ascribed then:
      For evermore so let it be.
         Amen, yea, and amen.</pre>
