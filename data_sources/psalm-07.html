<p><em>Shiggaion of David, which he sang unto the Lord, concerning the words of Cush the
Benjamite</em>.</p>

<pre>   1  O Lord my God, in thee do I
         my confidence repose:
      Save and deliver me from all
         my persecuting foes;</pre>

<pre>   2  Lest that the enemy my soul
         should, like a lion, tear,
      In pieces rending it, while there
         is no deliverer.</pre>

<pre>   3  O Lord my God, if it be so
         that I committed this;
      If it be so that in my hands
         iniquity there is:</pre>

<pre>   4  If I rewarded ill to him
         that was at peace with me;
      (Yea, ev'n the man that without cause
         my foe was I did free;)</pre>

<pre>   5  Then let the foe pursue and take
         my soul, and my life thrust
      Down to the earth, and let him lay
         mine honor in the dust.</pre>

<pre>   6  Rise in thy wrath, Lord, raise thyself,
         for my foes raging be;
      And, to the judgment which thou hast
         commanded, wake for me.</pre>

<pre>   7  So shall th' assembly of thy folk
         about encompass thee:
      Thou, therefore, for their sakes, return
         unto thy place on high.</pre>

<pre>   8  The Lord he shall the people judge:
         my judge, Jehovah, be,
      After my righteousness, and mine
         integrity in me.</pre>

<pre>   9  O let the wicked's malice end;
         but stablish stedfastly
      The righteous: for the righteous God
         the hearts and reins doth try.</pre>

<pre>  10  In God, who saves th' upright in heart,
         is my defense and stay.
  11  God just men judgeth, God is wroth
         with ill men ev'ry day.</pre>

<pre>  12  If he do not return again,
         then he his sword will whet;
      His bow he hath already bent,
         and hath it ready set:</pre>

<pre>  13  He also hath for him prepared
         the instruments of death;
      Against the persecutors he
         his shafts ordained hath.</pre>

<pre>  14  Behold, he with iniquity
         doth travail, as in birth;
      A mischief he conceived hath,
         and falsehood shall bring forth.</pre>

<pre>  15  He made a pit and digged it deep,
         another there to take;
      But he is fall'n into the ditch
         which he himself did make.</pre>

<pre>  16  Upon his own head his mischief
         shall be returned home;
      His vi'lent dealing also down
         on his own pate shall come.</pre>

<pre>  17  According to his righteousness
         the Lord I'll magnify;
      And will sing praise unto the name
         of God that is most high.</pre>
