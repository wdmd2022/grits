<pre>   1  Why rage the heathen? and vain things
         why do the people mind?
   2  Kings of the earth do set themselves,
         and princes are combined,</pre>

<pre>      To plot against the Lord, and his
         Anointed, saying thus,
   3  Let us asunder break their bands,
         and cast their cords from us.</pre>

<pre>   4  He that in heaven sits shall laugh;
         the Lord shall scorn them all.
   5  Then shall he speak to them in wrath,
         in rage he vex them shall.</pre>

<pre>   6  Yet, notwithstanding, I have him
         to be my King appointed;
      And over Zion, my holy hill,
         I have him King anointed.</pre>

<pre>   7  The sure decree I will declare:
         The Lord hath said to me,
      Thou art mine only Son; this day
         I have begotten thee.</pre>

<pre>   8  Ask of me, and for heritage
         the heathen I'll make thine;
      And, for possession, I to thee
         will give earth's utmost line.</pre>

<pre>   9  Thou shalt, as with a weighty rod
         of iron, break them all;
      And, as a potter's sherd, thou shalt
         them dash in pieces small.</pre>

<pre>  10  Now therefore, kings, be wise; be taught,
         ye judges of the earth:
  11  Serve God in fear, and see that ye
         join trembling with your mirth.</pre>

<pre>  12  Kiss ye the Son, lest in his ire
         ye perish from the way,
      If once his wrath begin to burn:
         blessed all that on him stay.</pre>
