<blockquote>
  <p><em>To the chief Musician upon Mahalath, Maschil, A Psalm of David. </em></p>
</blockquote>

<pre>   1  That there is not a God, the fool
         doth in his heart conclude:
      They are corrupt, their works are vile,
         not one of them doth good.</pre>

<pre>   2  The Lord upon the sons of men
         from heav'n did cast his eyes,
      To see if any one there was
         that sought God, and was wise.</pre>

<pre>   3  They altogether filthy are,
         they all are backward gone;
      And there is none that doeth good,
         no, not so much as one.</pre>

<pre>   4  These workers of iniquity,
         do they not know at all,
      That they my people eat as bread,
         and on God do not call?</pre>

<pre>   5  Ev'n there they were afraid, and stood
         with trembling, all dismayed,
      Whereas there was no cause at all
         why they should be afraid:</pre>

<pre>      For God his bones that thee besieged
         hath scattered all abroad;
      Thou hast confounded them, for they
         despised are of God.</pre>

<pre>   6  Let Isr'el's help from Zion come:
         when back the Lord shall bring
      His captives, Jacob shall rejoice,
         and Israel shall sing.</pre>
