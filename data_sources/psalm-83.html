<p><em>Song or Psalm of Asaph.</em></p>

<pre>   1  Keep not, O God, we thee entreat,
         O keep not silence now:
      Do thou not hold thy peace, O God,
         and still no more be thou.</pre>

<pre>   2  For, lo, thine enemies a noise
         tumultuously have made;
      And they that haters are of thee
         have lifted up the head.</pre>

<pre>   3  Against thy chosen people they
         do crafty counsel take;
      And they against thy hidden ones
         do consultations make.</pre>

<pre>   4  Come, let us cut them off, said they,
         from being a nation,
      That of the name of Isr'el may
         no more be mention.</pre>

<pre>   5  For with joint heart they plot, in league
         against thee they combine.
   6  The tents of Edom, Ishm'elites,
         Moab's and Hagar's line;</pre>

<pre>   7  Gebal, and Ammon, Amalek,
        Philistines, those of Tyre;
   8  And Assur join'd with them, to help
         Lot's children they conspire.</pre>

<pre>   9  Do to them as to Midian,
         Jabin at Kison strand;
  10  And Sis'ra, which at En-dor fell,
         as dung to fat the land.</pre>

<pre>  11  Like Oreb and like Zeeb make
         their noble men to fall;
      Like Zeba and Zalmunna like,
         make thou their princes all;</pre>

<pre>  12  Who said, For our possession
         let us God's houses take.
  13  My God, them like a wheel, as chaff
         before the wind, them make.</pre>

<pre>  14  As fire consumes the wood, as flame
         doth mountains set on fire,
  15  Chase and affright them with the storm
         and tempest of thine ire.</pre>

<pre>  16  Their faces fill with shame, O Lord,
         that they may seek thy name.
  17  Let them confounded be, and vexed,
         and perish in their shame:</pre>

<pre>  18  That men may know that thou, to whom
         alone doth appertain
      The name Jehovah, dost most high
         o'er all the earth remain.</pre>
