 <pre>
    1  Praise ye the Lord. The man is blessed
          that fears the Lord aright,
       He who in his commandments
          doth greatly take delight.
 </pre>

 <pre>
    2  His seed and offspring powerful
          shall be the earth upon:
       Of upright men blesséd shall be
          the generation.
 </pre>

 <pre>
    3  Riches and wealth shall ever be
          within his house in store;
       And his unspotted righteousness
          endures for evermore.
 </pre>

 <pre>
    4  Unto the upright light doth rise,
          though he in darkness be:
       Compassionate, and merciful,
          and righteous, is he.
 </pre>

 <pre>
    5  A good man doth his favor show,
          and doth to others lend:
       He with discretion his affairs
          will guide unto the end.
 </pre>

 <pre>
    6  Surely there is not any thing
          that ever shall him move:
       The righteous man's memorial
          shall everlasting prove.
 </pre>

 <pre>
    7  When he shall evil tidings hear,
          he shall not be afraid:
       His heart is fixed, his confidence
          upon the Lord is stayed.
 </pre>

 <pre>
    8  His heart is firmly stablishéd,
          afraid he shall not be,
       Until upon his enemies
          he his desire shall see.
 </pre>

 <pre>
    9  He hath dispersed, giv'n to the poor;
          his righteousness shall be
       To ages all; with honor shall
          his horn be raised high.
 </pre>

<pre>
   10  The wicked shall it see, and fret,
          his teeth gnash, melt away:
       What wicked men do most desire
          shall utterly decay.
</pre>
