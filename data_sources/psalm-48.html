<p><em><font FACE="Times New Roman">A Song and Psalm for the sons of Korah. </font></em></p>

<pre>   1  Great is the Lord, and greatly he
         is to be praised still,
      Within the city of our God,
         upon his holy hill.</pre>

<pre>   2  Mount Zion stands most beautiful,
         the joy of all the land;
      The city of the mighty King
         on her north side doth stand.</pre>

<pre>   3  The Lord within her palaces
         is for a refuge known.
   4  For, lo, the kings that gathered were
         together, by have gone.</pre>

<pre>   5  But when they did behold the same,
         they, wond'ring, would not stay;
      But, being troubled at the sight,
         they thence did haste away.</pre>

<pre>   6  Great terror there took hold on them;
         they were possessed with fear;
      Their grief came like a woman's pain,
         when she a child doth bear.</pre>

<pre>   7  Thou Tarshish ships with east wind break'st:
   8     As we have heard it told,
      So, in the city of the Lord,
         our eyes did it behold;</pre>

<pre>      In our God's city, which his hand
         for ever stablish will.
   9  We of thy loving-kindness thought,
         Lord, in thy temple still.</pre>

<pre>  10  O Lord, according to thy name,
         through all the earth's thy praise;
      And thy right hand, O Lord, is full
         of righteousness always.</pre>

<pre>  11  Because thy judgments are made known,
         let Zion mount rejoice;
      Of Judah let the daughters all
         send forth a cheerful voice.</pre>

<pre>  12  Walk about Zion, and go round;
         the high tow'rs thereof tell:
  13  Consider ye her palaces,
         and mark her bulwarks well;

      That ye may tell posterity.
  14     For this God doth abide
      Our God for evermore; he will
         ev'n unto death us guide.</pre>
