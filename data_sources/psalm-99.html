<pre>   1  Th' eternal Lord doth reign as king,
         let all the people quake;
      He sits between the cherubims,
         let th' earth be moved and shake.</pre>

<pre>   2  The Lord in Zion great and high
         above all people is;
   3  Thy great and dreadful name (for it
         is holy) let them bless.</pre>

<pre>   4  The king's strength also judgment loves;
         thou settlest equity:
      Just judgment thou dost execute
         in Jacob righteously.</pre>

<pre>   5  The Lord our God exalt on high,
         and rev'rently do ye
      Before his footstool worship him:
         the Holy One is he.</pre>

<pre>   6  Moses and Aaron 'mong his priests,
         Samuel, with them that call
      Upon his name: these called on God,
         and he them answered all.</pre>

<pre>   7  Within the pillar of the cloud
         he unto them did speak:
      The testimonies he them taught,
         and laws, they did not break.</pre>

<pre>   8  Thou answer'dst them, O Lord our God;
         thou wast a God that gave
      Pardon to them, though on their deeds
         thou wouldest vengeance have.</pre>

<pre>   9  Do ye exalt the Lord our God,
         and at his holy hill
      Do ye him worship: for the Lord
         our God is holy still.</pre>
