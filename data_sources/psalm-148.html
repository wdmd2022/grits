  <pre>
     1  Praise God. From heavens praise the Lord,
           in heights praise to him be.
     2  All ye his angels, praise ye him;
           his hosts all, praise him ye.
  </pre>

  <pre>
     3  O praise ye him, both sun and moon,
           praise him, all stars of light.
     4  Ye heav'ns of heav'ns him praise, and floods
           above the heavens' height.
  </pre>

  <pre>
     5  Let all the creatures praise the name
           of our almighty Lord:
        For he commanded, and they were
           created by his word.
  </pre>

  <pre>
     6  He also, for all times to come,
           hath them established sure;
        He hath appointed them a law,
           which ever shall endure.
  </pre>

  <pre>
     7  Praise ye Jehovah from the earth,
           dragons, and ev'ry deep:
     8  Fire, hail, snow, vapor, stormy wind,
           his word that fully keep.
  </pre>

  <pre>
     9  All hills and mountains, fruitful trees,
           and all ye cedars high:
      10  Beasts, and all cattle, creeping things,
           and all ye birds that fly.
  </pre>

 <pre>
    11  Kings of the earth, all nations,
           princes, earth's judges all:
    12  Both young men, yea, and maidens too,
           old men, and children small.
 </pre>

 <pre>
    13  Let them God's name praise; for his name
           alone is excellent:
        His glory reacheth far above
           the earth and firmament.
 </pre>

 <pre>
    14  His people's horn, the praise of all
           his saints, exalteth he;
        Ev'n Isr'el's seed, a people near
           to him. The Lord praise ye.
 </pre>
