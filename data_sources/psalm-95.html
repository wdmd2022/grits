<pre>   1  O come, let us sing to the Lord:
         come, let us ev'ry one
      A joyful noise make to the Rock
         of our salvation.</pre>

<pre>   2  Let us before his presence come
         with praise and thankful voice;
      Let us sing psalms to him with grace,
         and make a joyful noise.</pre>

<pre>   3  For God, a great God, and great King,
         above all gods he is.
   4  Depths of the earth are in his hand,
         the strength of hills is his.</pre>

<pre>   5  To him the spacious sea belongs,
         for he the same did make;
      The dry land also from his hands
         its form at first did take.</pre>

<pre>   6  O come, and let us worship him,
         let us bow down withal,
      And on our knees before the Lord
         our Maker let us fall.</pre>

<pre>   7  For he's our God, the people we
         of his own pasture are,
      And of his hand the sheep; to-day,
         if ye his voice will hear,</pre>

<pre>   8  Then harden not your hearts, as in
         the provocation,
      As in the desert, on the day
         of the tentation:</pre>

<pre>   9  When me your fathers tempted and proved,
         and did my working see;
  10    Ev'n for the space of forty years
           this race hath grieved me.</pre>

<pre>      I said, This people errs in heart,
         my ways they do not know:
  11  To whom I swore in wrath, that to
         my rest they should not go.</pre>
