<pre><em>To the chief Musician, A Psalm for the sons of Korah</em></pre>

<pre>   1  Hear this, all people, and give ear,
         all in the world that dwell;
   2  Both low and high, both rich and poor.
   3     My mouth shall wisdom tell:</pre>

<pre>      My heart shall knowledge meditate.
   4      I will incline mine ear
      To parables, and on the harp
         my sayings dark declare.</pre>

<pre>   5  Amidst those days that evil be,
         why should I, fearing, doubt?
      When of my heels th' iniquity
         shall compass me about.</pre>

<pre>   6  Whoe'er they be that in their wealth
         their confidence do pitch,
      And boast themselves, because they are
         become exceeding rich:</pre>

<pre>   7  Yet none of these his brother can
         redeem by any way;
      Nor can he unto God for him
         sufficient ransom pay,</pre>

<pre>   8  (Their soul's redemption precious is,
         and it can never be,)
   9  That still he should for ever live,
         and not corruption see.</pre>

<pre>  10  For why? he seeth that wise men die,
         and brutish fools also
      Do perish; and their wealth, when dead,
         to others they let go.</pre>

<pre>  11  Their inward thought is, that their house
         and dwelling-places shall
      Stand through all ages; they their lands
         by their own names do call.</pre>

<pre>  12  But yet in honor shall not man
         abide continually;
      But passing hence, may be compared
         unto the beasts that die.</pre>

<pre>  13  Thus brutish folly plainly is
         their wisdom and their way;
      Yet their posterity approve
         what they do fondly say.</pre>

<pre>  14  Like sheep they in the grave are laid,
         and death shall them devour;
      And in the morning upright men
         shall over them have pow'r:</pre>

<pre>      Their beauty from their dwelling shall
         consume within the grave.
  15  But from hell's hand God will me free,
         for he shall me receive.</pre>

<pre>  16  Be thou not then afraid when one
         enriched thou dost see,
      Nor when the glory of his house
         advanced is on high:</pre>

<pre>  17  For he shall carry nothing hence
         when death his days doth end;
      Nor shall his glory after him
         into the grave descend.</pre>

<pre>  18  Although he his own soul did bless
         whilst he on earth did live;
      (And when thou to thyself dost well,
         men will thee praises give;)</pre>

<pre>  19  He to his fathers' race shall go,
         they never shall see light.
  20  Man honored wanting knowledge is
         like beasts that perish quite.</pre>
