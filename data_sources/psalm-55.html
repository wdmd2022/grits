<pre><em>To the chief Musician on Neginoth, Maschil,
A Psalm of David. 
</em>
   1  Lord, hear my pray'r, hide not thyself
         from my entreating voice:
   2  Attend and hear me; in my plaint
         I mourn and make a noise.</pre>

<pre>   3  Because of th' en'my's voice, and for
         lewd men's oppression great:
      On me they cast iniquity,
         and they in wrath me hate.</pre>

<pre>   4  Sore pained within me is my heart:
         death's terrors on me fall.
   5  On me comes trembling, fear and dread
         o'erwhelm√®d me withal.</pre>

<pre>   6  O that I, like a dove, had wings,
         said I, then would I flee
      Far hence, that I might find a place
         where I in rest might be.</pre>

<pre>   7  Lo, then far off I wander would,
         and in the desert stay;
   8  From windy storm and tempest I
         would haste to 'scape away.</pre>

<pre>   9  O Lord, on them destruction bring,
         and do their tongues divide;
      For in the city violence
         and strife I have espied.</pre>

<pre>  10  They day and night upon the walls
         do go about it round:
      There mischief is, and sorrow there
         in midst of it is found.</pre>

<pre>  11  Abundant wickedness there is
         within her inward part;
      And from her streets deceitfulness
         and guile do not depart.</pre>

<pre>  12  He was no foe that me reproached,
         then that endure I could;
      Nor hater that did 'gainst me boast,
         from him me hide I would.</pre>

<pre>  13  But thou, man, who mine equal, guide,
         and mine acquaintance wast:
  14  We joined sweet counsels, to God's house
         in company we past.</pre>

<pre>  15  Let death upon them seize, and down
         let them go quick to hell;
      For wickedness doth much abound
         among them where they dwell.</pre>

<pre>  16  I'll call on God: God will me save.
  17     I'll pray, and make a noise
       At ev'ning, morning, and at noon;
         and he shall hear my voice.</pre>

<pre>  18  He hath my soul delivered,
         that it in peace might be
      From battle that against me was;
         for many were with me.</pre>

<pre>  19  The Lord shall hear, and them afflict,
         of old who hath abode:
      Because they never changes have,
         therefore they fear not God.</pre>

<pre>  20  'Gainst those that were at peace with him
         he hath put forth his hand:
      The covenant that he had made,
         by breaking he profaned.</pre>

<pre>  21  More smooth than butter were his words,
         while in his heart was war;
      His speeches were more soft than oil,
         and yet drawn swords they are.</pre>

<pre>  22  Cast thou thy burden on the Lord,
         and he shall thee sustain;
      Yea, he shall cause the righteous man
         unmoved to remain.</pre>

<pre>  23  But thou, O Lord my God, those men
         in justice shalt o'erthrow,
      And in destruction's dungeon dark
         at last shalt lay them low:</pre>

<pre>      The bloody and deceitful men
         shall not live half their days:
      But upon thee with confidence
         I will depend always.</pre>
