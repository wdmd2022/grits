<pre>   1  Praise ye the Lord: unto him sing
         a new song, and his praise
      In the assembly of his saints
         in sweet psalms do ye raise.</pre>

<pre>   2  Let Isr'el in his Maker joy,
         and to him praises sing:
      Let all that Zion's children are
         be joyful in their King.</pre>

<pre>   3  O let them unto his great name
         give praises in the dance;
      Let them with timbrel and with harp
         in songs his praise advance.</pre>

<pre>   4  For God doth pleasure take in those
         that his own people be;
      And he with his salvation
         the meek will beautify.</pre>

<pre>   5  And in his glory excellent
         let all his saints rejoice:
      Let them to him upon their beds
         aloud lift up their voice.</pre>

<pre>   6  Let in their mouth aloft be raised
         the high praise of the Lord,
      And let them have in their right hand
         a sharp two-edged sword;</pre>

<pre>   7  To execute the vengeance due
         upon the heathen all,
      And make deserved punishment
         upon the people fall.</pre>

<pre>   8  And ev'n with chains, as pris'ners, bind
         their kings that them command;
      Yea, and with iron fetters strong,
         the nobles of their land.</pre>

<pre>   9  On them the judgment to perform
         found written in his word:
      This honor is to all his saints.
         O do ye praise the Lord. </pre>
