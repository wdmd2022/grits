 <pre>
        1  David, and his afflictions all,
              Lord, do thou think upon;
        2  How unto God he sware, and vowed
              to Jacob's mighty One.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        3  I will not come within my house,
              nor rest in bed at all;
        4  Nor shall mine eyes take any sleep,
              nor eyelids slumber shall;
 </pre>

 <pre>
        5  Till for the Lord a place I find,
              where he may make abode;
           A place of habitation
              for Jacob's mighty God.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        6  Lo, at the place of Ephratah
              of it we understood;
           And we did find it in the fields,
              and city of the wood.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        7  We'll go into his tabernacles,
              and at his footstool bow.
        8  Arise, O Lord, into thy rest,
              th' ark of thy strength, and thou.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        9  O let thy priests be cloth√®d, Lord,
              with truth and righteousness;
           And let all those that are thy saints
              shout loud for joyfulness.
 </pre>

<pre>
       10  For thine own servant David's sake,
              do not deny thy grace;
           Nor of thine own anointed one
              turn thou away the face.
</pre>

<pre>
       11  The Lord in truth to David sware,
              he will not turn from it,
           I of thy body's fruit will make
              upon thy throne to sit.
</pre>

<pre>
       12  My cov'nant if thy sons will keep,
              and laws to them made known,
           Their children then shall also sit
              for ever on thy throne.
</pre>

<pre>
       13  For God of Zion hath made choice;
              there he desires to dwell.
       14  This is my rest, here still I'll stay;
              for I do like it well.
</pre>

<pre>
       15  Her food I'll greatly bless; her poor
              with bread will satisfy.
       16  Her priests I'll clothe with health; her saints
              shall shout forth joyfully.
</pre>

<pre>
       17  And there will I make David's horn
              to bud forth pleasantly:
           For him that mine anointed is
              a lamp ordained have I.
</pre>

<pre>
       18  As with a garment I will clothe
              with shame his en'mies all:
           But yet the crown that he doth wear
              upon him flourish shall.
</pre>
