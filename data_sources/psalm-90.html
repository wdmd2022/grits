<p><em><font FACE="Times New Roman">A Prayer of Moses the man of God. </font></em></p>

<pre>   1  Lord, thou hast been our dwelling-place
         in generations all.
   2  Before thou ever hadst brought forth
         the mountains great or small;</pre>

<pre>      Ere ever thou hadst formed the earth,
         and all the world abroad;
      Ev'n thou from everlasting art
         to everlasting God.</pre>

<pre>   3  Thou dost unto destruction
         man that is mortal turn;
      And unto them thou say'st, Again,
         ye sons of men, return.</pre>

<pre>   4  Because a thousand years appear
         no more before thy sight
      Than yesterday, when it is past,
         or than a watch by night.</pre>

<pre>   5  As with an overflowing flood
         thou carry'st them away:
      They like a sleep are, like the grass
         that grows at morn are they.</pre>

<pre>   6  At morn it flourishes and grows,
         cut down at ev'n doth fade.
   7  For by thine anger we're consumed,
         thy wrath makes us afraid.</pre>

<pre>   8  Our sins thou and iniquities
         dost in thy presence place,
      And sett'st our secret faults before
         the brightness of thy face.</pre>

<pre>   9  For in thine anger all our days
         do pass on to an end;
      And as a tale that hath been told,
         so we our years do spend.</pre>

<pre>  10  Threescore and ten years do sum up
         our days and years, we see;
      Or, if, by reason of more strength,
         in some fourscore they be:</pre>

<pre>      Yet doth the strength of such old men
         but grief and labor prove;
      For it is soon cut off, and we
         fly hence, and soon remove.</pre>

<pre>  11  Who knows the power of thy wrath?
         according to thy fear
  12  So is thy wrath: Lord, teach thou us
         our end in mind to bear;</pre>

<pre>      And so to count our days, that we
         our hearts may still apply
      To learn thy wisdom and thy truth,
         that we may live thereby.</pre>

<pre>  13  Turn yet again to us, O Lord,
         how long thus shall it be?
      Let it repent thee now for those
         that servants are to thee.</pre>

<pre>  14  O with thy tender mercies, Lord,
         us early satisfy;
      So we rejoice shall all our days,
         and still be glad in thee.</pre>

<pre>  15  According as the days have been,
         wherein we grief have had,
      And years wherein we ill have seen,
         so do thou make us glad.</pre>

<pre>  16  O let thy work and pow'r appear
         thy servants' face before;
      And show unto their children dear
         thy glory evermore:</pre>

<pre>  17  And let the beauty of the Lord
         our God be us upon:
      Our handy-works establish thou,
         establish them each one.</pre>
