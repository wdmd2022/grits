<pre>   1  Wherefore is it that thou, O Lord,
         dost stand from us afar?
      And wherefore hidest thou thyself,
         when times so troublous are?</pre>

<pre>   2  The wicked in his loftiness
         doth persecute the poor:
      In these devices they have framed
         let them be taken sure.</pre>

<pre>   3  The wicked of his heart's desire
         doth talk with boasting great;
      He blesseth him that's covetous,
         whom yet the Lord doth hate.</pre>

<pre>   4  The wicked, through his pride of face,
         on God he doth not call;
      And in the counsels of his heart
         the Lord is not at all.</pre>

<pre>   5  His ways they always grievous are;
         thy judgments from his sight
      Removed are: at all his foes
         he puffeth with despight.</pre>

<pre>   6  Within his heart he thus hath said,
         I shall not moved be;
      And no adversity at all
         shall ever come to me.</pre>

<pre>   7  His mouth with cursing, fraud, deceit,
         is filled abundantly;
      And underneath his tongue there is
         mischief and vanity.</pre>

<pre>   8  He closely sits in villages;
         he slays the innocent:
      Against the poor that pass him by
         his cruel eyes are bent.</pre>

<pre>   9  He, lion-like, lurks in his den;
         he waits the poor to take;
      And when he draws him in his net,
         his prey he doth him make. </pre>

<pre>  10  Himself he humbleth very low,
         he croucheth down withal,
      That so a multitude of poor
         may by his strong ones fall.</pre>

<pre>  11  He thus hath said within his heart,
         The Lord hath quite forgot;
      He hides his countenance, and he
         for ever sees it not.</pre>

<pre>  12  O Lord, do thou arise; O God,
         lift up thine hand on high:
      Put not the meek afflicted ones
         out of thy memory.</pre>

<pre>  13  Why is it that the wicked man
         thus doth the Lord despise?
      Because that God will it require
         he in his heart denies.</pre>

<pre>  14  Thou hast it seen; for their mischief
         and spite thou wilt repay:
      The poor commits himself to thee;
         thou art the orphan's stay.</pre>

<pre>  15  The arm break of the wicked man,
         and of the evil one;
      Do thou seek out his wickedness,
         until thou findest none.</pre>

<pre>  16  The Lord is King through ages all,
         ev'n to eternity;
      The heathen people from his land
         are perished utterly.</pre>

<pre>  17  O Lord, of those that humble are
         thou the desire didst hear;
      Thou wilt prepare their heart, and thou
         to hear wilt bend thine ear;</pre>

<pre>  18  To judge the fatherless, and those
         that are oppressed sore;
      That man, that is but sprung of earth,
         may them oppress no more.</pre>
