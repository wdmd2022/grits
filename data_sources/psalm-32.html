<pre>A <i>Psalm</i> of David, Maschil.</pre>

<pre>   1  O blessed is the man to whom
         is freely pardoned
      All the transgression he hath done,
         whose sin is covered.</pre>

<pre>   2  Bless√®d is the man to whom the Lord
         imputeth not his sin,
      And in whose sp'rit there is no guile,
         nor fraud is found therein.</pre>

<pre>   3  When as I did refrain my speech,
         and silent was my tongue,
      My bones then waxed old, because
         I roared all day long.</pre>

<pre>   4  For upon me both day and night
         thine hand did heavy lie,
      So that my moisture turned is
         in summer's drought thereby. </pre>

<pre>   5  I thereupon have unto thee
         my sin acknowledged,
      And likewise mine iniquity
         I have not covered: </pre>

<pre>      I will confess unto the Lord
         my trespasses, said I;
      And of my sin thou freely didst
         forgive th' iniquity. </pre>

<pre>   6  For this shall ev'ry godly one
         his prayer make to thee;
      In such a time he shall thee seek,
         as found thou mayest be. </pre>

<pre>      Surely, when floods of waters great
         do swell up to the brim,
      They shall not overwhelm his soul,
         nor once come near to him. </pre>

<pre>   7  Thou art my hiding-place, thou shalt
         from trouble keep me free:
      Thou with songs of deliverance
         about shalt compass me. </pre>

<pre>   8  I will instruct thee, and thee teach
         the way that thou shalt go;
      And, with mine eye upon thee set,
         I will direction show. </pre>

<pre>   9  Then be not like the horse or mule,
         which do not understand;
      Whose mouth, lest they come near to thee,
         a bridle must command. </pre>

<pre>  10  Unto the man that wicked is
         his sorrows shall abound;
      But him that trusteth in the Lord
         mercy shall compass round. </pre>

<pre>  11  Ye righteous, in the Lord be glad,
         in him do ye rejoice:
      All ye that upright are in heart,
         for joy lift up your voice.</pre>
