<pre>   1  All lands to God in joyful sounds,
         aloft your voices raise.
   2  Sing forth the honor of his name,
         and glorious make his praise.</pre>

<pre>   3  Say unto God, How terrible
         in all thy works art thou!
      Through thy great pow'r thy foes to thee
         shall be constrained to bow.</pre>

<pre>   4  All on the earth shall worship thee,
         they shall thy praise proclaim
      In songs: they shall sing cheerfully
         unto thy holy name.</pre>

<pre>   5  Come, and the works that God hath wrought
         with admiration see:
      In's working to the sons of men
         most terrible is he.</pre>

<pre>   6  Into dry land the sea he turned,
         and they a passage had;
      Ev'n marching through the flood on foot,
         there we in him were glad.</pre>

<pre>   7  He ruleth ever by his pow'r;
         his eyes the nations see:
      O let not the rebellious ones
         lift up themselves on high.</pre>

<pre>   8  Ye people, bless our God; aloud
         the voice speak of his praise:
   9  Our soul in life who safe preserves,
         our foot from sliding stays.</pre>

<pre>  10  For thou didst prove and try us, Lord,
         as men do silver try;
  11  Brought'st us into the net, and mad'st
         bands on our loins to lie.</pre>

<pre>  12  Thou hast caused men ride o'er our heads;
         and though that we did pass
      Through fire and water, yet thou brought'st
         us to a wealthy place.</pre>

<pre>  13  I'll bring burnt off 'rings to thy house;
         to thee my vows I'll pay,
  14  Which my lips uttered, my mouth spake,
         when trouble on me lay.</pre>

<pre>  15  Burnt-sacrifices of fat rams
         with incense I will bring;
      Of bullocks and of goats I will
         present an offering.</pre>

<pre>  16  All that fear God, come, hear, I'll tell
         what he did for my soul.
  17  I with my mouth unto him cried,
         my tongue did him extol.</pre>

<pre>  18  If in my heart I sin regard,
         the Lord me will not hear:
  19  But surely God me heard, and to
         my prayer's voice gave ear.</pre>

<pre>  20  O let the Lord, our gracious God,
         for ever blessed be,
      Who turned not my pray'r from him,
         nor yet his grace from me.</pre>
