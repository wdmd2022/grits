 <pre>
    1  O blessed ever be the Lord,
          who is my strength and might,
       Who doth instruct my hands to war,
          my fingers teach to fight.
 </pre>

 <pre>
    2  My goodness, fortress, my high tow'r,
          deliverer, and shield,
       In whom I trust: who under me
          my people makes to yield.
 </pre>

 <pre>
    3  Lord, what is man, that thou of him
          dost so much knowledge take?
       Or son of man, that thou of him
          so great account dost make?
 </pre>

 <pre>
    4  Man is like vanity; his days,
          as shadows, pass away.
    5  Lord, bow thy heav'ns, come down,
          touch thou the hills, and smoke shall they.
 </pre>

 <pre>
    6  Cast forth thy lightning, scatter them;
          thine arrows shoot, them rout.
    7  Thine hand send from above, me save;
          from great depths draw me out;
 </pre>

    <pre>
       And from the hand of children strange,
        8     Whose mouth speaks vanity;
       And their right hand is a right hand
          that works deceitfully.
    </pre>

 <pre>
    9  A new song I to thee will sing,
          Lord, on a psaltery;
       I on a ten-stringed instrument
          will praises sing to thee.
 </pre>

<pre>
   10  Ev'n he it is that unto kings
          salvation doth send;
       Who his own servant David doth
          from hurtful sword defend.
</pre>

<pre>
   11  O free me from strange children's hand,
          whose mouth speaks vanity;
       And their right hand a right hand is
          that works deceitfully.
</pre>

<pre>
   12  That, as the plants, our sons may be
          in youth grown up that are;
       Our daughters like to corner-stones,
          carved like a palace fair.
</pre>

<pre>
   13  That to afford all kind of store
          our garners may be filled;
       That our sheep thousands, in our streets
          ten thousands they may yield.
</pre>

<pre>
   14  That strong our oxen be for work,
          that no in-breaking be,
       Nor going out; and that our streets
          may from complaints be free.
</pre>

<pre>
   15  Those people blessed are who be
          in such a case as this;
       Yea, blessed all those people are,
          whose God Jehovah is.
</pre>
