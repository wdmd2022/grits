<pre>   1  Save me, O God, because the floods
         do so environ me,
      That ev'n unto my very soul
         come in the waters be.</pre>

<pre>   2  I downward in deep mire do sink,
         where standing there is none:
      I am into deep waters come,
         where floods have o'er me gone.</pre>

<pre>   3  I weary with my crying am,
         my throat is also dried;
      Mine eyes do fail, while for my God
         I waiting do abide.</pre>

<pre>   4  Those men that do without a cause
         bear hatred unto me,
      Than are the hairs upon my head
         in number more they be:</pre>

<pre>      They that would me destroy, and are
         mine en'mies wrongfully,
      Are mighty: so what I took not,
         to render forced was I.</pre>

<pre>   5  Lord, thou my folly know'st, my sins
         not covered are from thee.
   6  Let none that wait on thee be shamed,
         Lord God of hosts, for me.</pre>

<pre>      O Lord, the God of Israel,
         let none, who search do make,
      And seek thee, be at any time
         confounded for my sake.</pre>

<pre>   7  For I have borne reproach for thee,
         my face is hid with shame.
   8  To brethren strange, to mother's sons
         an alien I became.</pre>

<pre>   9  Because the zeal did eat me up,
         which to thine house I bear;
      And the reproaches cast at thee,
         upon me fallen are.</pre>

<pre>  10  My tears and fasts, t' afflict my soul,
         were turned to my shame.
  11  When sackcloth I did wear, to them
         a proverb I became.</pre>

<pre>  12  The men that in the gate do sit
         against me evil spake;
      They also that vile drunkards were
         of me their song did make.</pre>

<pre>  13  But, in an acceptable time,
         my pray'r, Lord, is to thee:
      In truth of thy salvation, Lord,
         and mercy great, hear me.</pre>

<pre>  14  Deliver me out of the mire,
         from sinking do me keep;
      Free me from those that do me hate,
         and from the waters deep.</pre>

<pre>  15  Let not the flood on me prevail,
         whose water overflows;
      Nor deep me swallow, nor the pit
         her mouth upon me close.</pre>

<pre>  16  Hear me, O Lord, because thy love
         and kindness is most good;
      Turn unto me, according to
         thy mercies' multitude.</pre>

<pre>  17  Nor from thy servant hide thy face:
         I'm troubled, soon attend.
  18  Draw near my soul, and it redeem;
         me from my foes defend.</pre>

<pre>  19  To thee is my reproach well known,
         my shame, and my disgrace:
      Those that mine adversaries be
          are all before thy face.</pre>

<pre>  20  Reproach hath broke my heart; I'm full
         of grief: I looked for one
      To pity me, but none I found;
         comforters found I none.</pre>

<pre>  21  They also bitter gall did give
         unto me for my meat:
      They gave me vinegar to drink,
         when as my thirst was great.</pre>

<pre>  22  Before them let their table prove
         a snare; and do thou make
      Their welfare and prosperity
         a trap themselves to take.</pre>

<pre>  23  Let thou their eyes so darkened be,
         that sight may them forsake;
      And let their loins be made by thee
         continually to shake.</pre>

<pre>  24  Thy fury pour thou out on them,
         and indignation;
      And let thy wrathful anger, Lord,
         fast hold take them upon.</pre>

<pre>  25  All waste and desolate let be
         their habitation;
      And in their tabernacles all
         inhabitants be none.</pre>

<pre>  26  Because him they do persecute,
         whom thou didst smite before;
      They talk unto the grief of those
         whom thou hast wounded sore.</pre>

<pre>  27  Add thou iniquity unto
         their former wickedness;
      And do not let them come at all
         into thy righteousness.</pre>

<pre>  28  Out of the book of life let them
         be razed and blotted quite;
      Among the just and righteous
         let not their names be writ.</pre>

<pre>  29  But now become exceeding poor
         and sorrowful am I:
      By thy salvation, O my God,
         let me be set on high.</pre>

<pre>  30  The name of God I with a song
         most cheerfully will praise;
      And I, in giving thanks to him,
         his name shall highly raise.</pre>

<pre>  31  This to the Lord a sacrifice
         more gracious shall prove
      Than bullock, ox, or any beast
         that hath both horn and hoof.</pre>

<pre>  32  When this the humble men shall see,
         it joy to them shall give:
      O all ye that do seek the Lord,
         your hearts shall ever live.</pre>

<pre>  33  For God the poor hears, and will not
         his prisoners contemn.
  34  Let heav'n, and earth, and seas, him praise,
         and all that move in them.</pre>

<pre>  35  For God will Judah's cities build,
         and he will Zion save,
      That they may dwell therein, and it
         in sure possession have.</pre>

<pre>  36  And they that are his servants' seed
         inherit shall the same;
      So shall they have their dwelling there
         that love his bless√®d name.</pre>
