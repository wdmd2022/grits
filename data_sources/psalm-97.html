<pre>
      1  God reigneth, let the earth be glad,
             and isles rejoice each one.
       2  Dark clouds him compass; and in right
             with judgment dwells his throne.
</pre>

 <pre>
       3  Fire goes before him, and his foes
             it burns up round about:
       4  His lightnings lighten did the world;
             earth saw, and shook throughout.
 </pre>

 <pre>
       5  Hills at the presence of the Lord,
             like wax, did melt away;
          Ev'n at the presence of the Lord
             of all the earth, I say.
 </pre>

 <pre>
       6  The heav'ns declare his righteousness,
             all men his glory see.
       7  All who serve graven images,
             confounded let them be.
 </pre>

    <pre>
          Who do of idols boast themselves,
             let shame upon them fall:
          Ye that are called gods, see that
             ye do him worship all.
    </pre>

 <pre>
       8  Zion did hear, and joyful was,
             glad Judah's daughters were;
          They much rejoiced, O Lord, because
             thy judgments did appear.
 </pre>

 <pre>
       9  For thou, O Lord, art high above
             all things on earth that are;
          Above all other gods thou art
             exalted very far.
 </pre>

<pre>
      10  Hate ill, all ye that love the Lord:
             his saints' souls keepeth he;
          And from the hands of wicked men
             he sets them safe and free.
</pre>

<pre>
      11  For all those that be righteous
             sown is a joyful light,
          And gladness sown is for all those
             that are in heart upright.
</pre>

<pre>
      12  Ye righteous, in the Lord rejoice;
             express your thankfulness,
          When ye into your memory
             do call his holiness.
</pre>
