<pre>   1  O Lord, my hope and confidence
         is placed in thee alone;
      Then let thy servant never be
         put to confusion.</pre>

<pre>   2  And let me, in thy righteousness,
         from thee deliv'rance have;
      Cause me escape, incline thine ear
         unto me, and me save.</pre>

<pre>   3  Be thou my dwelling-rock, to which
         I ever may resort:
      Thou gav'st commandment me to save,
         for thou'rt my rock and fort.</pre>

<pre>   4  Free me, my God, from wicked hands,
         hands cruel and unjust:
   5  For thou, O Lord God, art my hope,
         and from my youth my trust.</pre>

<pre>   6  Thou from the womb didst hold me up;
         thou art the same that me
      Out of my mother's bowels took;
         I ever will praise thee.</pre>

<pre>   7  To many I a wonder am;
         but thou'rt my refuge strong.
   8  Filled let my mouth be with thy praise
         and honor all day long.</pre>

<pre>   9  O do not cast me off, when as
         old age doth overtake me;
      And when my strength decayed is,
         then do not thou forsake me.</pre>

<pre>  10  For those that are mine enemies
         against me speak with hate;
      And they together counsel take
         that for my soul lay wait.</pre>

<pre>  11  They said, God leaves him; him pursue
         and take: none will him save.
  12  Be thou not far from me, my God:
         thy speedy help I crave.</pre>

<pre>  13  Confound, consume them, that unto
         my soul are enemies:
      Clothed be they with reproach and shame
         that do my hurt devise.</pre>

<pre>  14  But I with expectation
         will hope continually;
      And yet with praises more and more
         I will thee magnify.</pre>

<pre>  15  Thy justice and salvation
         my mouth abroad shall show,
      Ev'n all the day; for I thereof
         the numbers do not know.</pre>

<pre>  16  And I will constantly go on
         in strength of God the Lord;
      And thine own righteousness, ev'n thine
         alone, I will record.</pre>

<pre>  <a name="v17">17</a>  For even from my youth, O God,
         by thee I have been taught;
      And hitherto I have declared
         the wonders thou hast wrought.</pre>

<pre>  18  And now, Lord, leave me not, when I
         old and gray-headed grow:
      Till to this age thy strength and pow'r
         to all to come I show.</pre>

<pre>  19  And thy most perfect righteousness
         O Lord, is very high,
      Who hast so great things done: O God,
         who is like unto thee?</pre>

<pre>  20  Thou, Lord, who great adversities,
         and sore, to me didst show,
      Shalt quicken, and bring me again
         from depths of earth below.</pre>

<pre>  21  My greatness and my pow'r thou wilt
         increase, and far extend:
      On ev'ry side against all grief
         thou wilt me comfort send.</pre>

<pre>  22  Thee, ev'n thy truth, I'll also praise,
         my God, with psaltery:
      Thou Holy One of Israel,
         with harp I'll sing to thee.</pre>

<pre>  23  My lips shall much rejoice in thee,
         when I thy praises sound;
      My soul, which thou redeem√®d hast,
         in joy shall much abound.</pre>

<pre>  24  My tongue thy justice shall proclaim,
         continuing all day long;
      For they confounded are, and shamed,
         that seek to do me wrong.</pre>
