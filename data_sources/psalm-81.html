  <p><font face="Times New Roman">To the chief Musician upon Gittith,<i><br>
  A Psalm</i> of Asaph. </font></p>
</blockquote>

<pre>   1  Sing loud to God our strength; with joy
         to Jacob's God do sing.
   2  Take up a psalm, the pleasant harp,
         timbrel and psalt'ry bring.</pre>

<pre>   3  Blow trumpets at new-moon, what day
         our feast appointed is:
   4  For charge to Isr'el, and a law
         of Jacob's God was this.</pre>

<pre>   5  To Joseph this a testimony
         he made, when Egypt land
      He traveled through, where speech I heard
         I did not understand.</pre>

<pre>   6  His shoulder I from burdens took,
         his hands from pots did free.
   7  Thou didst in trouble on me call,
         and I delivered thee:</pre>

<pre>      In secret place of thundering
         I did thee answer make;
      And at the streams of Meribah
         of thee a proof did take.</pre>

<pre>   8  O thou, my people, give an ear,
         I'll testify to thee;
      To thee, O Isr'el, if thou wilt
         but hearken unto me.</pre>

<pre>   9  In midst of thee there shall not be
         any strange god at all;
      Nor unto any god unknown
         thou bowing down shalt fall.</pre>

<pre>  10  I am the Lord thy God, which did
         from Egypt land thee guide;
      I'll fill thy mouth abundantly,
         do thou it open wide.</pre>

<pre>  11  But yet my people to my voice
         would not attentive be;
      And ev'n my chosen Israel
         he would have none of me.</pre>

<pre>  12  So to the lust of their own hearts
         I them delivered;
      And then in counsels of their own
         they vainly wandered.</pre>

<pre>  13  O that my people had me heard,
         Isr'el my ways had chose!
  14  I had their en'mies soon subdued,
         my hand turned on their foes.</pre>

<pre>  15  The haters of the Lord to him
         submission should have feigned;
      But as for them, their time should have
         for evermore remained.</pre>

<pre>  16  He should have also fed them with
         the finest of the wheat;
      Of honey from the rock thy fill
         I should have made thee eat.</pre>
