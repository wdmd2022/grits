<pre>   1  Let God arise, and scatter√®d
         let all his en'mies be;
      And let all those that do him hate
         before his presence flee.</pre>

<pre>   2  As smoke is driv'n, so drive thou them;
         as fire melts wax away,
      Before God's face let wicked men
         so perish and decay.</pre>

<pre>   3  But let the righteous be glad:
         let them before God's sight
      Be very joyful; yea, let them
         rejoice with all their might.</pre>

<pre>   4  To God sing, to his name sing praise;
         extol him with your voice,
      That rides on heav'n, by his name Jah,
         before his face rejoice.</pre>

<pre>   5  Because the Lord a father is
         unto the fatherless;
      God is the widow's judge, within
         his place of holiness.</pre>

<pre>   6  God doth the solitary set
         in fam'lies: and from bands
      The chain'd doth free; but rebels do
         inhabit parched lands.</pre>

<pre>   7  O God, what time thou didst go forth
         before thy people's face;
      And when through the great wilderness
         thy glorious marching was;</pre>

<pre>   8  Then at God's presence shook the earth,
         then drops from heaven fell;
      This Sinai shook before the Lord,
         the God of Israel.</pre>

<pre>   9  O God, thou to thine heritage
         didst send a plenteous rain,
      Whereby thou, when it weary was,
         didst it refresh again.</pre>

<pre>  10  Thy congregation then did make
         their habitation there:
      Of thine own goodness for the poor,
         O God, thou didst prepare.</pre>

<pre>  11  The Lord himself did give the word,
         the word abroad did spread;
      Great was the company of them
         the same who published.</pre>

<pre>  12  Kings of great armies foiled were,
         and forced to flee away;
      And women, who remained at home,
         did distribute the prey.</pre>

<pre>  13  Though ye have lien among the pots,
         like doves ye shall appear,
      Whose wings with silver, and with gold
         whose feathers covered are.</pre>

<pre>  14  When there th' Almighty scatter'd kings,
         like Salmon's snow 'twas white.
  15  God's hill is like to Bashan hill,
         like Bashan hill for height.</pre>

<pre>  16  Why do ye leap, ye mountains high?
         this is the hill where God
      Desires to dwell; yea, God in it
         for aye will make abode.</pre>

<pre>  17  God's chariots twenty thousand are,
         thousands of angels strong;
      In's holy place God is, as in
         mount Sinai, them among.</pre>

<pre>  18  Thou hast, O Lord, most glorious,
         ascended up on high;
      And in triumph victorious led
         captive captivity:</pre>

<pre>      Thou hast received gifts for men,
         for such as did rebel;
      Yea, ev'n for them, that God the Lord
         in midst of them might dwell.</pre>

<pre>  19  Blessed be the Lord, who is to us
         of our salvation God;
      Who daily with his benefits
         us plenteously doth load.</pre>

<pre>  20  He of salvation is the God,
         who is our God most strong;
      And unto God the Lord from death
         the issues do belong.</pre>

<pre>  21  But surely God shall wound the head
         of those that are his foes;
      The hairy scalp of him that still
         on in his trespass goes.</pre>

<pre>  22  God said, My people I will bring
         again from Bashan hill;
      Yea, from the sea's devouring depths
         them bring again I will;</pre>

<pre>  23  That in the blood of enemies
         thy foot imbrued may be,
      And of thy dogs dipped in the same
         the tongues thou mayest see.</pre>

<pre>  24  Thy goings they have seen, O God;
         the steps of majesty
      Of my God, and my mighty King,
         within the sanctuary.</pre>

<pre>  25  Before went singers, players next
         on instruments took way;
      And them among the damsels were
         that did on timbrels play.</pre>

<pre>  26  Within the congregations
         bless God with one accord:
      From Isr'el's fountain do ye bless
         and praise the mighty Lord.</pre>

<pre>  27  With their prince, little Benjamin,
         princes and council there
      Of Judah were, there Zabulon's
         and Napht'li's princes were.</pre>

<pre>  28  Thy God commands thy strength; make strong
         what thou wrought'st for us, Lord.
  29  For thy house at Jerusalem
         kings shall thee gifts afford.</pre>

<pre>  30  The spearmen's host, the multitude
         of bulls, which fiercely look,
      Those calves which people have forth sent,
         O Lord our God, rebuke,</pre>

<pre>      Till ev'ry one submit himself,
         and silver pieces bring:
      The people that delight in war
         disperse, O God and King.</pre>

<pre>  31  Those that be princes great shall then
         come out of Egypt lands;
      And Ethiopia to God
         shall soon stretch out her hands.</pre>

<pre>  32  O all ye kingdoms of the earth,
         sing praises to this King;
      For he is Lord that ruleth all,
         unto him praises sing.</pre>

<pre>  33  To him that rides on heav'ns of heav'ns,
         which he of old did found;
      Lo, he sends out his voice, a voice
         in might that doth abound.</pre>

<pre>  34  Strength unto God do ye ascribe;
         for his excellency
      Is over Israel, his strength
         is in the clouds most high.</pre>

<pre>  35  Thou'rt from thy temple dreadful, Lord;
         Isr'el's own God is he,
      Who gives his people strength and pow'r:
         O let God blessed be.</pre>
