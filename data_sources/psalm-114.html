 <pre>
       1  When Isr'el out of Egypt went,
             and did his dwelling change,
          When Jacob's house went out from those
             that were of language strange,
 </pre>

 <pre>
       2  He Judah did his sanctuary,
             his kingdom Isr'el make:
       3  The sea it saw, and quickly fled,
             Jordan was driven back.
 </pre>

 <pre>
       4  Like rams the mountains, and like lambs
             the hills skipped to and fro.
       5  O sea, why fledd'st thou? Jordan, back
             why wast thou driven so?
 </pre>

 <pre>
       6  Ye mountains great, wherefore was it
             that ye did skip like rams?
          And wherefore was it, little hills,
             that ye did leap like lambs?
 </pre>

 <pre>
       7  O at the presence of the Lord,
             earth, tremble thou for fear,
          While as the presence of the God
             of Jacob doth appear:
 </pre>

 <pre>
       8  Who from the hard and stony rock
             did standing water bring;
          And by his pow'r did turn the flint
             into a water-spring.
 </pre>
