12  With stretch'd-out arm, and with strong hand:
       for his grace faileth never.</pre>

<pre>21  Their land in heritage to have:
       (for mercy hath he ever.)
22  His servant Isr'el right he gave:
       for his grace faileth never.</pre>

<pre>23  In our low state who on us thought:
       for he hath mercy ever.
24  And from our foes our freedom wrought:
       for his grace faileth never.</pre>

<pre>25  Who doth all flesh with food relieve:
       for he hath mercy ever.
26  Thanks to the God of heaven give:
       for his grace faileth never.</pre>
