<pre><em><font FACE="Times New Roman">To the chief Musician,
A Psalm of David. </font></em></pre>

 <pre>
        1  O Lord, thou hast me searched and known.
        2      Thou know'st my sitting down,
           And rising up; yea, all my thoughts
              afar to thee are known.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        3  My footsteps, and my lying down,
              thou compassest always;
           Thou also most entirely art
              acquaint with all my ways.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        4  For in my tongue, before I speak,
              not any word can be,
           But altogether, lo, O Lord,
              it is well known to thee.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        5  Behind, before, thou hast beset,
              and laid on me thine hand.
        6  Such knowledge is too strange for me,
              too high to understand.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        7  From thy Sp'rit whither shall I go?
              or from thy presence fly?
        8  Ascend I heav'n, lo, thou art there;
              there, if in hell I lie.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        9  Take I the morning wings, and dwell
              in utmost parts of sea;
        10  Ev'n there, Lord, shall thy hand me lead,
              thy right hand hold shall me.
 </pre>

<pre>
       11  If I do say that darkness shall
              me cover from thy sight,
           Then surely shall the very night
              about me be as light.
</pre>

<pre>
       12  Yea, darkness hideth not from thee,
              but night doth shine as day:
           To thee the darkness and the light
              are both alike alway.
</pre>

<pre>
       13  For thou possessed hast my reins,
              and thou hast covered me,
           When I within my mother's womb
              enclos√®d was by thee.
</pre>

<pre>
       14  Thee will I praise; for fearfully
              and strangely made I am;
           Thy works are marv'llous, and right well
              my soul doth know the same.
</pre>

<pre>
       15  My substance was not hid from thee,
              when as in secret I
           Was made; and in earth's lowest parts
              was wrought most curiously.
</pre>

<pre>
       16  Thine eyes my substance did behold,
              yet being unperfect;
           And in the volume of thy book
              my members all were writ;
</pre>

    <pre>
           Which after in continuance
              were fashioned ev'ry one,
           When as they yet all shapeless were,
              and of them there was none.
    </pre>

<pre>
       17  How precious also are thy thoughts,
              O gracious God, to me!
           And in their sum how passing great
              and numberless they be!
</pre>

<pre>
       18  If I should count them, than the sand
              they more in number be:
           What time soever I awake,
              I ever am with thee.
</pre>

<pre>
       19  Thou, Lord, wilt sure the wicked slay:
              hence from me bloody men.
       20  Thy foes against thee loudly speak,
              and take thy name in vain.
</pre>

<pre>
       21  Do not I hate all those, O Lord,
              that hatred bear to thee?
           With those that up against thee rise
              can I but grieved be?
</pre>

<pre>
       22  With perfect hatred them I hate,
              my foes I them do hold.
       23  Search me, O God, and know my heart,
              try me, my thoughts unfold:
</pre>

<pre>
       24  And see if any wicked way
              there be at all in me;
           And in thine everlasting way
              to me a leader be.
</pre>
