<pre>   1  To thee I lift my soul, O Lord:
   2     My God, I trust in thee:
      Let me not be ashamed; let not
         my foes triumph o'er me.</pre>

<pre>   3  Yea, let thou none ashamed be
         that do on thee attend:
      Ashamed let them be, O Lord,
         who without cause offend.</pre>

<pre>   4  Thy ways, Lord, show; teach me thy paths:
   5     Lead me in truth, teach me:
      For of my safety thou art God;
         all day I wait on thee.</pre>

<pre>   6  Thy mercies, that most tender are,
         do thou, O Lord, remember,
      And loving-kindnesses; for they
         have been of old for ever.</pre>

<pre>   7  Let not the errors of my youth,
         nor sins, remembered be:
      In mercy, for thy goodness' sake,
         O Lord, remember me.</pre>

<pre>   8  The Lord is good and gracious,
         he upright is also:
      He therefore sinners will instruct
         in ways that they should go.</pre>

<pre>   9  The meek and lowly he will guide
         in judgment just alway:
      To meek and poor afflicted ones
         he'll clearly teach his way.</pre>

<pre>  10  The whole paths of the Lord our God
         are truth and mercy sure,
      To such as keep his covenant,
         and testimonies pure.</pre>

<pre>  11  Now, for thine own name's sake, O Lord,
         I humbly thee entreat
      To pardon mine iniquity;
         for it is very great.</pre>

<pre>  12  What man fears God? him shall he teach
         the way that he shall choose.
  13  His soul shall dwell at ease; his seed
         the earth, as heirs, shall use.</pre>

<pre>  14  The secret of the Lord is with
         such as do fear his name;
      And he his holy covenant
         will manifest to them.</pre>

<pre>  15  Towards the Lord my waiting eyes
         continually are set;
      For he it is that shall bring forth
         my feet out of the net.</pre>

<pre>  16  O turn thee unto me, O God,
         have mercy me upon;
      Because I solitary am,
         and in affliction.</pre>

<pre>  17  Enlarged the griefs are of mine heart;
         me from distress relieve.
  18  See mine affliction and my pain,
         and all my sins forgive.</pre>

<pre>  19  Consider thou mine enemies,
         because they many are;
      And it a cruel hatred is
         which they against me bear.</pre>

<pre>  20  O do thou keep my soul; O God,
         do thou deliver me:
      Let me not be ashamed; for I
         do put my trust in thee.</pre>

<pre>  21  O let integrity and truth
         keep me, who thee attend.
  22  Redemption, Lord, to Israel
         from all his troubles send.</pre>
