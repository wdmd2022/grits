<blockquote>
  <p><font FACE="Times New Roman"><i>A Psalm</i> of David. </font></p>
</blockquote>

<pre>   1  Plead, Lord, with those that plead; and fight
         with those that fight with me.
   2  Of shield and buckler take thou hold,
         stand up mine help to be.</pre>

<pre>   3  Draw also out the spear, and do
         against them stop the way
      That me pursue: unto my soul,
         I'm thy salvation, say.</pre>

<pre>   4  Let them confounded be and shamed
         that for my soul have sought:
      Who plot my hurt turned back be they,
         and to confusion brought.</pre>

<pre>   5  Let them be like unto the chaff
         that flies before the wind;
      And let the angel of the Lord
         pursue them hard behind.</pre>

<pre>   6  With darkness cover thou their way,
         and let it slipp'ry prove;
      And let the angel of the Lord
         pursue them from above.</pre>

<pre>   7  For without cause have they for me
         their net hid in a pit,
      They also have without a cause
         for my soul digg√®d it.</pre>

<pre>   8  Let ruin seize him unawares;
         his net he hid withal
      Himself let catch; and in the same
         destruction let him fall.</pre>

<pre>   9  My soul in God shall joy; and glad
         in his salvation be:
  10  And all my bones shall say, O Lord,
         who is like unto thee,</pre>

<pre>      Which dost the poor set free from him
         that is for him too strong;
      The poor and needy from the man
         that spoils and does him wrong?</pre>

<pre>  11  False witnesses rose; to my charge
         things I not knew they laid.
  12  They, to the spoiling of my soul,
         me ill for good repaid.</pre>

<pre>  13  But as for me, when they were sick,
         in sackcloth sad I mourned:
      My humbled soul did fast, my pray'r
         into my bosom turned.</pre>

<pre>  14  Myself I did behave as he
         had been my friend or brother;
      I heavily bowed down, as one
         that mourneth for his mother.</pre>

<pre>  15  But in my trouble they rejoiced,
         gath'ring themselves together;
      Yea, objects vile together did
         themselves against me gather:</pre>

<pre>      I knew it not; they did me tear,
         and quiet would not be.
  16  With mocking hypocrites, at feasts
         they gnashed their teeth at me.</pre>

<pre>  17  How long, Lord, look'st thou on? from those
         destructions they intend
      Rescue my soul, from lions young
         my darling do defend.</pre>

<pre>  18  I will give thanks to thee, O Lord,
         within th' assembly great;
      And where much people gathered are
         thy praises forth will set.</pre>

<pre>  19  Let not my wrongful enemies
         proudly rejoice o'er me;
      Nor who me hate without a cause,
         let them wink with the eye.</pre>

<pre>  20  For peace they do not speak at all;
         but crafty plots prepare
      Against all those within the land
         that meek and quiet are.</pre>

<pre>  21  With mouths set wide, they 'gainst me said,
         Ha, ha! our eye doth see.
  22  Lord, thou hast seen, hold not thy peace;
         Lord, be not far from me.</pre>

<pre>  23  Stir up thyself; wake, that thou may'st
         judgment to me afford,
      Ev'n to my cause, O thou that art
         my only God and Lord.</pre>

<pre>  24  O Lord my God, do thou me judge
         after thy righteousness;
      And let them not their joy 'gainst me
         triumphantly express:</pre>

<pre>  25  Nor let them say within their hearts,
         Ah, we would have it thus;
      Nor suffer them to say, that he
         is swallowed up by us.</pre>

<pre>  26  Shamed and confounded be they all
         that at my hurt are glad;
      Let those against me that do boast
         with shame and scorn be clad.</pre>

<pre>  27  Let them that love my righteous cause
         be glad, shout, and not cease
      To say, The Lord be magnified,
         who loves his servant's peace.</pre>

<pre>  28  Thy righteousness shall also be
         declared by my tongue;
      The praises that belong to thee
         speak shall it all day long.</pre>
