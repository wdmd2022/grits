<pre>   1  My soul with expectation
         depends on God indeed;
      My strength and my salvation doth
         from him alone proceed.</pre>

<pre>   2  He only my salvation is,
         and my strong rock is he:
      He only is my sure defense;
         much moved I shall not be.</pre>

<pre>   3  How long will ye against a man
         plot mischief? ye shall all
      Be slain; ye as a tott'ring fence
         shall be, and bowing wall.</pre>

<pre>   4  They only plot to cast him down
         from his excellency:
      They joy in lies; with mouth they bless,
         but they curse inwardly.</pre>

<pre>   5  My soul, wait thou with patience
         upon thy God alone;
      On him dependeth all my hope
         and expectation.</pre>

<pre>   6  He only my salvation is,
         and my strong rock is he;
      He only is my sure defense:
         I shall not moved be.</pre>

<pre>   7  In God my glory placed is,
         and my salvation sure;
      In God the rock is of my strength,
         my refuge most secure.</pre>

<pre>   8  Ye people, place your confidence
         in him continually;
      Before him pour ye out your heart:
         God is our refuge high.</pre>

<pre>   9  Surely mean men are vanity,
         and great men are a lie;
      In balance laid, they wholly are
         more light than vanity.</pre>

<pre>  10  Trust ye not in oppression,
         in robb'ry be not vain;
      On wealth set not your hearts, when as
         increased is your gain.</pre>

<pre>  11  God hath it spoken once to me,
         yea, this I heard again,
      That power to Almighty God
         alone doth appertain.</pre>

<pre>  12  Yea, mercy also unto thee
         belongs, O Lord, alone:
      For thou according to his work
         rewardest ev'ry one.</pre>
