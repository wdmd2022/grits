 <pre>
    1  O Lord, I unto thee do cry,
          do thou make haste to me,
       And give an ear unto my voice,
          when I cry unto thee.
 </pre>

 <pre>
    2  As incense let my prayer be
          directed in thine eyes;
       And the uplifting of my hands
          as th' ev 'ning sacrifice.
 </pre>

 <pre>
    3  Set, Lord, a watch before my mouth,
          keep of my lips the door.
    4  My heart incline thou not unto
          the ills I should abhor,
 </pre>

    <pre>
       To practice wicked works with men
          that work iniquity;
       And with their delicates my taste
          let me not satisfy.
    </pre>

 <pre>
    5  Let him that righteous is me smite,
          it shall a kindness be;
       Let him reprove, I shall it count
          a precious oil to me:
 </pre>

    <pre>
       Such smiting shall not break my head;
          for yet the time shall fall,
       When I in their calamities
          to God pray for them shall.
    </pre>

 <pre>
    6  When as their judges down shall be
          in stony places cast,
       Then shall they hear my words; for they
          shall sweet be to their taste.
 </pre>

 <pre>
    7  About the grave's devouring mouth
          our bones are scattered round,
       As wood which men do cut and cleave
          lies scattered on the ground.
 </pre>

 <pre>
    8  But unto thee, O God the Lord,
          mine eyes uplifted be:
       My soul do not leave destitute;
          my trust is set on thee.
 </pre>

 <pre>
    9  Lord, keep me safely from the snares
          which they for me prepare;
       And from the subtle gins of them
          that wicked workers are.
 </pre>

<pre>
   10  Let workers of iniquity
          into their own nets fall,
       Whilst I do, by thine help, escape
          the danger of them all.
</pre>
