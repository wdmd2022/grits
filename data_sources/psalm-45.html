  <i>First Version</i>

<pre>   1  My heart brings forth a goodly thing;
         my words that I indite
      Concern the King: my tongue's a pen
         of one that swift doth write.</pre>
<pre>   2  Thou fairer art than sons of men:
         into thy lips is store
      Of grace infused; God therefore thee
         hath blessed for evermore.</pre>
<pre>   3  O thou that art the mighty One,
         thy sword gird on thy thigh;
      Ev'n with thy glory excellent,
         and with thy majesty.</pre>
<pre>   4  For meekness, truth, and righteousness,
         in state ride prosp'rously;
      And thy right hand shall thee instruct
         in things that fearful be.</pre>
<pre>   5  Thine arrows sharply pierce the heart
         of th' en'mies of the King;
      And under thy subjection
         the people down do bring.</pre>
<pre>   6  For ever and for ever is,
         O God, thy throne of might;
      The scepter of thy kingdom is
         a scepter that is right.</pre>
<pre>   7  Thou lovest right, and hatest ill;
         for God, thy God, most high,
      Above thy fellows hath with th' oil
         of joy anointed thee.</pre>
<pre>   8  Of aloes, myrrh, and cassia,
         a smell thy garments had,
      Out of the iv'ry palaces,
         whereby they made thee glad.</pre>
<pre>   9  Among thy women honorable
         kings' daughters were at hand:
      Upon thy right hand did the queen
         in gold of Ophir stand.</pre>
<pre>  10  O daughter, hearken and regard,
         and do thine ear incline;
      Likewise forget thy father's house,
         and people that are thine.</pre>
<pre>  11  Then of the King desired shall be
         thy beauty veh'mently:
      Because he is thy Lord, do thou
         him worship rev'rently.</pre>
<pre>  12  The daughter there of Tyre shall be
         with gifts and off 'rings great:
      Those of the people that are rich
         thy favor shall entreat.</pre>
<pre>  13  Behold, the daughter of the King
         all glorious is within;
      And with embroideries of gold
         her garments wrought have been.</pre>
<pre>  14  She shall be brought unto the King
         in robes with needle wrought;
      Her fellow-virgins following
         shall unto thee be brought.</pre>
<pre>  15  They shall be brought with gladness great,
         and mirth on ev'ry side,
      Into the palace of the King,
         and there they shall abide.</pre>
<pre>  16  Instead of those thy fathers dear,
         thy children thou may'st take,
      And in all places of the earth
         them noble princes make.</pre>
<pre>  17  Thy name remembered I will make
         through ages all to be:
      The people therefore evermore
         shall praises give to thee.</pre>
