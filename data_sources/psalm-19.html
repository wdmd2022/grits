<p><em>To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David. </em></p>

<pre>   1  The heav'ns God's glory do declare,
         the skies his hand-works preach:
   2  Day utters speech to day, and night
         to night doth knowledge teach.</pre>

<pre>   3  There is no speech nor tongue to which
         their voice doth not extend:
   4  Their line is gone through all the earth,
         their words to the world's end.</pre>

<pre>      In them he set the sun a tent;
   5     Who, bridegroom-like, forth goes
      From's chamber, as a strong man doth
         to run his race rejoice.</pre>

<pre>   6  From heav'n's end is his going forth,
         circling to th' end again;
      And there is nothing from his heat
         that hidden doth remain.</pre>

<pre>   7  God's law is perfect, and converts
         the soul in sin that lies:
      God's testimony is most sure,
         and makes the simple wise.</pre>

<pre>   8  The statutes of the Lord are right,
         and do rejoice the heart:
      The Lord's command is pure, and doth
         light to the eyes impart.</pre>

<pre>   9  Unspotted is the fear of God,
         and doth endure for ever:
      The judgments of the Lord are true
         and righteous altogether.</pre>

<pre>  10  They more than gold, yea, much fine gold,
         to be desired are:
      Than honey, honey from the comb
         that droppeth, sweeter far.</pre>

<pre>  11  Moreover, they thy servant warn
         how he his life should frame:
      A great reward provided is
         for them that keep the same.</pre>

<pre>  12  Who can his errors understand?
         O cleanse thou me within
  13  From secret faults. Thy servant keep
         from all presumptuous sin:</pre>

<pre>      And do not suffer them to have
         dominion over me:
      Then, righteous and innocent,
         I from much sin shall be.</pre>

<pre>  14  The words which from my mouth proceed,
         the thoughts sent from my heart,
      Accept, O Lord, for thou my strength
         and my Redeemer art.</pre>
