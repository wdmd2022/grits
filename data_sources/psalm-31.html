<pre>   1  In thee, O Lord, I put my trust,
         shamed let me never be;
      According to thy righteousness
         do thou deliver me.</pre>

<pre>   2  Bow down thine ear to me, with speed
         send me deliverance:
      To save me, my strong rock be thou,
         and my house of defense.</pre>

<pre>   3  Because thou art my rock, and thee
         I for my fortress take;
      Therefore do thou me lead and guide,
         ev'n for thine own name's sake.</pre>

<pre>   4  And since thou art my strength, therefore
         pull me out of the net,
      Which they in subtlety for me
         so privily have set.</pre>

<pre>   5  Into thine hands I do commit
         my sp'rit: for thou art he,
      O thou, Jehovah, God of truth,
         that hast redeemèd me.</pre>

<pre>   6  Those that do lying vanities
         regard, I have abhorred:
      But as for me, my confidence
         is fixed on the Lord.</pre>

<pre>   7  I'll in thy mercy gladly joy:
         for thou my miseries
      Considered hast; thou hast my soul
         known in adversities:</pre>

<pre>   8  And thou hast not enclosèd me
         within the en'my's hand;
      And by thee have my feet been made
         in a large room to stand.</pre>

<pre>   9  O Lord, upon me mercy have,
         for trouble is on me:
      Mine eye, my belly, and my soul,
         with grief consumèd be.</pre>

<pre>  10  Because my life with grief is spent,
         my years with sighs and groans:
      My strength doth fail; and for my sin
         consumèd are my bones.</pre>

<pre>  11  I was a scorn to all my foes,
         and to my friends a fear;
      And specially reproached of those
         that were my neighbors near:</pre>

<pre>      When they me saw they from me fled.
  12     Ev'n so I am forgot,
      As men are out of mind when dead:
         I'm like a broken pot.</pre>

<pre>  13  For slanders I of many heard;
         fear compassed me, while they
      Against me did consult, and plot
         to take my life away.</pre>

<pre>  14  But as for me, O Lord, my trust
         upon thee I did lay;
      And I to thee, Thou art my God,
         did confidently say.</pre>

<pre>  15  My times are wholly in thine hand:
         do thou deliver me
      From their hands that mine enemies
         and persecutors be.</pre>

<pre>  16  Thy countenance to shine do thou
         upon thy servant make:
      Unto me give salvation,
         for thy great mercies' sake.</pre>

<pre>  17  Let me not be ashamed, O Lord,
         for on thee called I have:
      Let wicked men be shamed, let them
         be silent in the grave.</pre>

<pre>  18  To silence put the lying lips,
         that grievous things do say,
      And hard reports, in pride and scorn,
         on righteous men do lay.</pre>

<pre>  19  How great's the goodness thou for them
         that fear thee keep'st in store,
      And wrought'st for them that trust in thee
         the sons of men before!</pre>

<pre>  20  In secret of thy presence thou
         shalt hide them from man's pride:
      From strife of tongues thou closely shalt,
         as in a tent, them hide.</pre>

<pre>  21  All praise and thanks be to the Lord;
         for he hath magnified
      His wondrous love to me within
         a city fortified.</pre>

<pre>  22  For from thine eyes cut off I am,
         I in my haste had said;
      My voice yet heard'st thou, when to thee
         with cries my moan I made.</pre>

<pre>  23  O love the Lord, all ye his saints;
         because the Lord doth guard
      The faithful, and he plenteously
         proud doers doth reward.</pre>

<pre>  24  Be of good courage, and He strength
         unto your heart shall send,
      All ye whose hope and confidence
         doth on the Lord depend.</pre>
