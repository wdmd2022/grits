<pre>
   1  In thy great indignation,
          O Lord, rebuke me not;
       Nor on me lay thy chast'ning hand,
          in thy displeasure hot.
</pre>

 <pre>
    2  For in me fast thine arrows stick,
          thine hand doth press me sore:
    3  And in my flesh there is no health,
          nor soundness any more.
 </pre>

    <pre>
       This grief I have, because thy wrath
          is forth against me gone;
       And in my bones there is no rest,
          for sin that I have done.
    </pre>

 <pre>
    4  Because gone up above mine head
          my great transgressions be;
       And, as a weighty burden, they
          too heavy are for me.
 </pre>

 <pre>
    5  My wounds do stink, and are corrupt;
          my folly makes it so.
    6  I troubled am, and much bowed down;
          all day I mourning go.
 </pre>

 <pre>
    7  For a disease that loathsome is
          so fills my loins with pain,
       That in my weak and weary flesh
          no soundness doth remain.
 </pre>

 <pre>
    8  So feeble and infirm am I,
          and broken am so sore,
       That, through disquiet of my heart,
          I have been made to roar.
 </pre>

 <pre>
    9  O Lord, all that I do desire
          is still before thine eye;
       And of my heart the secret groans
          not hidden are from thee.
 </pre>

<pre>
   10  My heart doth pant incessantly,
          my strength doth quite decay;
       As for mine eyes, their wonted light
          is from me gone away.
</pre>

<pre>
   11  My lovers and my friends do stand
          at distance from my sore;
       And those do stand aloof that were
          kinsmen and kind before.
</pre>

<pre>
   12  Yea, they that seek my life lay snares:
          who seek to do me wrong
       Speak things mischievous, and deceits
          imagine all day long.
</pre>

<pre>
   13  But, as one deaf, that heareth not,
          I suffered all to pass;
       I as a dumb man did become,
          whose mouth not opened was:
</pre>

<pre>
   14  As one that hears not, in whose mouth
          are no reproofs at all.
   15  For, Lord, I hope in thee; my God,
          thou'lt hear me when I call.
</pre>

<pre>
   16  For I said, Hear me, lest they should
          rejoice o'er me with pride;
       And o'er me magnify themselves,
          when as my foot doth slide.
</pre>

<pre>
   17  For I am near to halt, my grief
          is still before mine eye:
   18  For I'll declare my sin, and grieve
          for mine iniquity.
</pre>

<pre>
   19  But yet mine en'mies lively are,
          and strong are they beside;
       And they that hate me wrongfully
          are greatly multiplied.
</pre>

<pre>
   20  And they for good that render ill,
          as en'mies me withstood;
       Yea, ev'n for this, because that I
          do follow what is good.
</pre>

<pre>
   21  Forsake me not, O Lord; my God,
          far from me never be.
   22  O Lord, thou my salvation art,
          haste to give help to me.
</pre>
