<pre>   1  O God, why hast thou cast us off?
         is it for evermore?
      Against thy pasture-sheep why doth
         thine anger smoke so sore?</pre>

<pre>   2  O call to thy rememberance
         thy congregation,
      Which thou hast purchased of old;
         still think the same upon:</pre>

<pre>      The rod of thine inheritance,
         which thou redeemed hast,
      This Zion hill, wherein thou hadst
         thy dwelling in times past.</pre>

<pre>   3  To these long desolations
         thy feet lift, do not tarry;
      For all the ills thy foes have done
         within thy sanctuary.</pre>

<pre>   4  Amidst thy congregations
         thine enemies do roar:
      Their ensigns they set up for signs
         of triumph thee before.</pre>

<pre>   5  A man was famous, and was had
         in estimation,
      According as he lifted up
         his axe thick trees upon.</pre>

<pre>   6  But all at once with axes now
         and hammers they go to,
      And down the carved work thereof
         they break, and quite undo.</pre>

<pre>   7  They fired have thy sanctuary,
         and have defiled the same,
      By casting down unto the ground
         the place where dwelt thy name.</pre>

<pre>   8  Thus said they in their hearts, Let us
         destroy them out of hand:
      They burnt up all the synagogues
         of God within the land.</pre>

<pre>   9  Our signs we do not now behold;
         there is not us among
      A prophet more, nor any one
         that knows the time how long.</pre>

<pre>  10  How long, Lord, shall the enemy
         thus in reproach exclaim?
      And shall the adversary thus
         always blaspheme thy name?</pre>

<pre>  11  Thy hand, ev'n thy right hand of might,
         why dost thou thus draw back?
      O from thy bosom pluck it out
         for our deliv'rance sake.</pre>

<pre>  12  For certainly God is my King,
         ev'n from the times of old,
      Working in midst of all the earth
         salvation manifold.</pre>

<pre>  13  The sea, by thy great pow'r, to part
         asunder thou didst make;
      And thou the dragons' heads, O Lord,
         within the waters brake.</pre>

<pre>  14  The leviathan's head thou brak'st
         in pieces, and didst give
      Him to be meat unto the folk
         in wilderness that live.</pre>

<pre>  15  Thou clav'st the fountain and the flood,
         which did with streams abound:
      Thou dry'dst the mighty waters up
         unto the very ground.</pre>

<pre>  16  Thine only is the day, O Lord,
         thine also is the night;
      And thou alone prepared hast
         the sun and shining light.</pre>

<pre>  17  By thee the borders of the earth
         were settled ev'ry where:
      The summer and the winter both
         by thee created were.</pre>

<pre>  18  That th' enemy reproached hath,
         O keep it in record;
      And that the foolish people have
         blasphemed thy name, O Lord.</pre>

<pre>  19  Unto the multitude do not
         thy turtle's soul deliver:
      The congregation of thy poor
         do not forget for ever.</pre>

<pre>  20  Unto thy cov'nant have respect;
         for earth's dark places be
      Full of the habitations
         of horrid cruelty.</pre>

<pre>  21  O let not those that be oppressed
         return again with shame:
      Let those that poor and needy are
         give praise unto thy name.</pre>

<pre>  22  Do thou, O God, arise and plead
         the cause that is thine own:
      Remember how thou art reproached
         still by the foolish one.</pre>

<pre>  23  Do not forget the voice of those
         that are thine enemies:
      Of those the tumult ever grows
         that do against thee rise.</pre>
