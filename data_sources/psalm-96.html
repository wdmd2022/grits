<pre>   1  O sing a new song to the Lord:
         sing all the earth to God.
   2  To God sing, bless his name, show still
         his saving health abroad.</pre>

<pre>   3  Among the heathen nations
         his glory do declare;
      And unto all the people show
         his works that wondrous are.</pre>

<pre>   4  For great's the Lord, and greatly he
         is to be magnified;
      Yea, worthy to be feared is he
         above all gods beside.</pre>

<pre>   5  For all the gods are idols dumb,
         which blinded nations fear;
      But our God is the Lord, by whom
         the heav'ns created were.</pre>

<pre>   6  Great honor is before his face,
         and majesty divine;
      Strength is within his holy place,
         and there doth beauty shine.</pre>

<pre>   7  Do ye ascribe unto the Lord,
         of people ev'ry tribe,
      Glory do ye unto the Lord,
         and mighty pow'r ascribe.</pre>

<pre>   8  Give ye the glory to the Lord
         that to his name is due;
      Come ye into his courts, and bring
         an offering with you.</pre>

<pre>   9  In beauty of his holiness,
         O do the Lord adore;
      Likewise let all the earth throughout
         tremble his face before.</pre>

<pre>  10  Among the heathen say, God reigns;
         the world shall steadfastly
      Be fixed from moving; he shall judge
         the people righteously.</pre>

<pre>  11  Let heav'ns be glad before the Lord,
         and let the earth rejoice;
      Let seas, and all that is therein,
         cry out, and make a noise.</pre>

<pre>  12  Let fields rejoice, and ev'ry thing
         that springeth of the earth:
      Then woods and ev'ry tree shall sing
         with gladness and with mirth</pre>

<pre>  13  Before the Lord; because he comes,
         to judge the earth comes he:
      He'll judge the world with righteousness,
         the people faithfully.</pre>
