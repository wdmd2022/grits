 <pre>
        1  Praise God, for he is good: for still
              his mercies lasting be.
        2  Let God's redeemed say so, whom he
              from th' en'my's hand did free;
 </pre>

 <pre>
        3  And gathered them out of the lands,
              from north, south, east, and west.
        4  They strayed in desert's pathless way,
              no city found to rest.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        5  For thirst and hunger in them faints
        6     their soul. When straits them press,
           They cry unto the Lord, and he
              them frees from their distress.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        7  Them also in a way to walk
              that right is he did guide,
           That they might to a city go,
              wherein they might abide.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        8  O that men to the Lord would give
              praise for his goodness then,
           And for his works of wonder done
              unto the sons of men!
 </pre>

 <pre>
        9  For he the soul that longing is
              doth fully satisfy;
           With goodness he the hungry soul
              doth fill abundantly.
 </pre>

<pre>
       10  Such as shut up in darkness deep,
              and in death's shade abide,
           Whom strongly hath affliction bound,
              and irons fast have tried:
</pre>

<pre>
       11  Because against the words of God
              they wrought rebelliously,
           And they the counsel did contemn
              of him that is most High:
</pre>

<pre>
       12  Their heart he did bring down with grief,
              they fell, no help could have.
       13  In trouble then they cried to God,
              he them from straits did save.
</pre>

<pre>
       14   He out of darkness did them bring,
               and from death's shade them take;
            These bands, wherewith they had been bound,
               asunder quite he brake.
</pre>

<pre>
       15  O that men to the Lord would give
              praise for his goodness then,
           And for his works of wonder done
              unto the sons of men!
</pre>

<pre>
       16  Because the mighty gates of brass
              in pieces he did tear,
           By him in sunder also cut
              the bars of iron were.
</pre>

<pre>
       17  Fools, for their sin, and their offence,
              do sore affliction bear;
       18  All kind of meat their soul abhors;
              they to death's gates draw near.
</pre>

<pre>
       19  In grief they cry to God; he saves
              them from their miseries.
       20  He sends his word, them heals, and them
              from their destructions frees.
</pre>

<pre>
       21  O that men to the Lord would give
              praise for his goodness then,
           And for his works of wonder done
              unto the sons of men!
</pre>

<pre>
       22  And let them sacrifice to him
              off 'rings of thankfulness;
           And let them shew abroad his works
              in songs of joyfulness.
</pre>

<pre>
       23  Who go to sea in ships, and in
              great waters trading be,
       24  Within the deep these men God's works
              and his great wonders see.
</pre>

<pre>
       25  For he commands, and forth in haste
              the stormy tempest flies,
           Which makes the sea with rolling waves
              aloft to swell and rise.
</pre>

<pre>
       26  They mount to heav'n, then to the depths
              they do go down again;
           Their soul doth faint and melt away
              with trouble and with pain.
</pre>

<pre>
       27  They reel and stagger like one drunk,
              at their wit's end they be:
       28  Then they to God in trouble cry,
              who them from straits doth free.
</pre>

<pre>
       29  The storm is changèd into a calm
              at his command and will;
           So that the waves, which ragèd before,
              now quiet are and still.
</pre>

<pre>
       30  Then are they glad, because at rest
              and quiet now they be:
           So to the haven he them brings,
              which they desirèd to see.
</pre>

<pre>
       31  O that men to the Lord would give
              praise for his goodness then,
           And for his works of wonder done
              unto the sons of men!
</pre>

<pre>
       32  Among the people gather-ed
              let them exalt his name;
           Among assembled elders spread
              his most renown-ed fame.

       33  He to dry land turns water-springs,
              and floods to wilderness;
       34  For sins of those that dwell therein,
              fat land to barrenness.
</pre>

<pre>
       35  The burnt and parch-ed wilderness
              to water-pools he brings;
           The ground that was dried up before
              he turns to water-springs:
</pre>

<pre>
       36  And there, for dwelling, he a place
              doth to the hungry give,
           That they a city may prepare
              commodiously to live.
</pre>

<pre>
       37  There sow they fields, and vineyards plant,
              to yield fruits of increase.
       38  His blessing makes them multiply,
              lets not their beasts decrease.
</pre>

<pre>
       39  Again they are diminish-ed,
              and very low brought down,
           Through sorrow and affliction,
              and great oppression.
</pre>

<pre>
       40  He upon princes pours contempt,
              and causeth them to stray,
           And wander in a wilderness,
              wherein there is no way.
</pre>

<pre>
       41  Yet setteth he the poor on high
              from all his miseries,
           And he, much like unto a flock,
              doth make him families.
</pre>

<pre>
       42  They that are righteous shall rejoice,
              when they the same shall see;
           And, as ashamed, stop her mouth
              shall all iniquity.
</pre>

<pre>
       43  Whoso is wise, and will these things
              observe, and them record,
           Ev'n they shall understand the love
              and kindness of the Lord.
</pre>
