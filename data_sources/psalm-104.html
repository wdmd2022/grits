 <pre>
        1  Bless God, my soul. O Lord my God,
               thou art exceeding great;
            With honour and with majesty
               thou clothed art in state.
 </pre>

  <pre>
         2  With light, as with a robe, thyself
               thou coverest about;
            And, like unto a curtain, thou
               the heavens stretchest out.
  </pre>

  <pre>
         3  Who of his chambers doth the beams
               within the waters lay;
            Who doth the clouds his chariot make,
               on wings of wind make way.
  </pre>

  <pre>
         4  Who flaming fire his ministers,
               his angels sp'rits, doth make:
         5  Who earth's foundations did lay,
               that it should never shake.
  </pre>

  <pre>
         6  Thou didst it cover with the deep,
               as with a garment spread:
            The waters stood above the hills,
               when thou the word but said.
  </pre>

  <pre>
         7  But at the voice of thy rebuke
               they fled, and would not stay;
            They at thy thunder's dreadful voice
               did haste them fast away.
  </pre>

  <pre>
         8  They by the mountains do ascend,
               and by the valley-ground
            Descend, unto that very place
               which thou for them didst found.
  </pre>

  <pre>
         9  Thou hast a bound unto them set,
               that they may not pass over,
            That they do not return again
               the face of earth to cover.
  </pre>

 <pre>
        10  He to the valleys sends the springs,
               which run among the hills:
        11  They to all beasts of field give drink,
               wild asses drink their fills.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        12  By them the fowls of heav'n shall have
               their habitation,
            Which do among the branches sing
               with delectation.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        13  He from his chambers watereth
               the hills, when they are dry'd:
            With fruit and increase of thy works
               the earth is satisfied.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        14  For cattle he makes grass to grow,
               he makes the herb to spring
            For th' use of man, that food to him
               he from the earth may bring;
 </pre>

 <pre>
        15  And wine, that to the heart of man
               doth cheerfulness impart,
            Oil that his face makes shine, and bread
               that strengtheneth his heart.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        16  The trees of God are full of sap;
               the cedars that do stand
            In Lebanon, which planted were
               by his almighty hand.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        17  Birds of the air upon their boughs
               do chooe their nests to make;
            As for the stork, the fir-tree she
               doth for her dwelling take.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        18  The lofty mountains for wild goats
               a place of refuge be;
            The conies also to the rocks
               do for their safety flee.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        19  He sets the moon in heav'n, thereby
               the seasons to discern:
            From him the sun his certain time
               of going down doth learn.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        20  Thou darkness mak'st, 'tis night, then beasts
               of forests creep abroad.
        21  The lions young roar for their prey,
               and seek their meat from God.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        22  The sun doth rise, and home they flock,
               down in their dens they lie.
        23  Man goes to work, his labour he
               doth to the ev'ning ply.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        24  How manifold, Lord, are thy works!
               in wisdom wonderful
            Thou ev'ry one of them hast made;
               earth's of thy riches full:
 </pre>

 <pre>
        25  So is this great and spacious sea,
               wherein things creeping are,
            Which numbered cannot be; and beasts
               both great and small are there.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        26  There ships go; there thou mak'st to play
               that leviathan great.
        27  These all wait on thee, that thou may'st
               in due time give them meat.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        28  That which thou givest unto them
               they gather for their food;
            Thine hand thou open'st lib'rally,
               they fill-ed are with good.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        29  Thou hid'st thy face; they troubled are,
               their breath thou tak'st away;
            Then do they die, and to their dust
               return again do they.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        30  Thy quick'ning spirit thou send'st forth,
               then they created be;
            And then the earth's decay-ed face
               renew-ed is by thee.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        31  The glory of the mighty Lord
               continue shall for ever:
            The Lord Jehovah shall rejoice
               in all his works together.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        32  Earth, as affrighted, trembleth all,
               if he on it but look;
            And if the mountains he but touch,
               they presently do smoke.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        33  I will sing to the Lord most high,
               so long as I shall live;
            And while I being have I shall
               to my God praises give.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        34  Of him my meditation shall
               sweet thoughts to me afford;
            And as for me, I will rejoice
               in God, my only Lord.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        35  From earth let sinners be consumed,
               let ill men no more be.
            O thou my soul, bless thou the Lord.
               Praise to the Lord give ye.
 </pre>
