 <pre>
        1  Give praise and thanks unto the Lord,
               for bountiful is he;
            His tender mercy doth endure
               unto eternity.
 </pre>

  <pre>
         2  God's mighty works who can express?
               or shew forth all his praise?
         3  Blessed are they that judgment keep,
               and justly do always.
  </pre>

  <pre>
         4  Remember me, Lord, with that love
               which thou to thine dost bear;
            With thy salvation, O my God,
               to visit me draw near:
  </pre>

  <pre>
         5  That I thy chosen's good may see,
               and in their joy rejoice;
            And may with thine inheritance
               triumph with cheerful voice.
  </pre>

  <pre>
         6  We with our fathers sinned have,
               and of iniquity
            Too long we have the workers been;
               we have done wickedly.
  </pre>

  <pre>
         7  The wonders great, which thou, O Lord,
               didst work in Egypt land,
            Our fathers, though they saw, yet them
               they did not understand:
  </pre>

     <pre>
            And they thy mercies' multitude
               kept not in memory;
            But at the sea, ev'n the Red sea,
               provoked him grievously.
     </pre>

  <pre>
         8  Nevertheless he saved them,
               ev'n for his own name's sake;
            That so he might to be well known
               his mighty power make.
  </pre>

  <pre>
         9  When he the Red sea did rebuke,
               then dried up it was:
            Through depths, as through the wilderness,
               he safely made them pass.
  </pre>

 <pre>
        10  From hands of those that hated them
               he did his people save;
            And from the en'my's cruel hand
               to them redemption gave.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        11  The waters overwhelmed their foes;
               not one was left alive.
        12  Then they believed his word, and praise
               to him in songs did give.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        13  But soon did they his mighty works
               forget unthankfully,
            And on his counsel and his will
               did not wait patiently;
 </pre>

 <pre>
        14  But much did lust in wilderness,
               and God in desert tempt.
        15  He gave them what they sought, but to
               their soul he leanness sent.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        16  And against Moses in the camp
               their envy did appear;
            At Aaron they, the saint of God,
               envious also were.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        17  Therefore the earth did open wide,
               and Dathan did devour,
            And all Abiram's company
               did cover in that hour.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        18  Likewise among their company
               a fire was kindled then;
            And so the hot consuming flame
               burnt up these wicked men.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        19  Upon the hill of Horeb they
               an idol-calf did frame,
            A molten image they did make,
               and worshippèd the same.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        20  And thus their glory, and their God,
               most vainly changèd they
            Into the likeness of an ox
               that eateth grass or hay.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        21  They did forget the mighty God,
               that had their savior been,
            By whom such great things brought to pass
               they had in Egypt seen.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        22  In Ham's land he did wondrous works,
               things terrible did he,
            When he his mighty hand and arm
               stretched out at the Red sea.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        23  Then said he, He would them destroy,
               had not, his wrath to stay,
            His chosen Moses stood in breach,
               that them he should not slay.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        24  Yea, they despised the pleasant land,
               believèd not his word:
        25  But in their tents they murmur-ed,
               not heark'ning to the Lord.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        26  Therefore in desert them to slay
               he lifted up his hand:
        27  'Mong nations to o'erthrow their seed,
               and scatter in each land.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        28  They unto Baal-peor did
               themselves associate;
            The sacrifices of the dead
               they did profanely eat.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        29  Thus, by their lewd inventions,
               they did provoke his ire;
            And then upon them suddenly
               the plague brake in as fire.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        30  Then Phin'has rose, and justice did,
               and so the plague did cease;
        31  That to all ages counted was
               to him for righteousness.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        32  And at the waters, where they strove,
               they did him angry make,
            In such sort, that it fared ill
               with Moses for their sake:
 </pre>

 <pre>
        33  Because they there his spirit meek
               provokèd bitterly,
            So that he uttered with his lips
               words unadvisedly.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        34  Nor, as the Lord commanded them,
               did they the nations slay:
        35  But with the heathen mingled were,
               and learned of them their way.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        36  And they their idols served, which did
               a snare unto them turn.
        37  Their sons and daughters they to dev'ls
               in sacrifice did burn.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        38  In their own children's guiltless blood
               their hands they did imbrue,
            Whom to Canaan's idols they
               for sacrifices slew:
 </pre>

     <pre>
            So was the land defiled with blood.
             39       They stained with their own way,
            And with their own inventions
               a whoring they did stray.
     </pre>

 <pre>
        40  Against his people kindled was
               the wrath of God therefore,
            Insomuch that he did his own
               inheritance abhor.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        41  He gave them to the heathen's hand;
               their foes did them command.
        42  Their en'mies them oppressed, they were
               made subject to their hand.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        43  He many times delivered them;
               but with their counsel so
            They him provoked, that for their sin
               they were brought very low.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        44  Yet their affliction he beheld,
               when he did hear their cry:
        45  And he for them his covenant
               did call to memory;
 </pre>

     <pre>
            After his mercies' multitude
             46       he did repent: And made
            Them to be pitied of all those
               who did them captive lead.
     </pre>

 <pre>
        47  O Lord our God, us save, and gather
               the heathen from among,
            That we thy holy name may praise
               in a triumphant song.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        48  Blessed be Jehovah, Isr'el's God,
               to all eternity:
            Let all the people say, Amen.
               Praise to the Lord give ye.
