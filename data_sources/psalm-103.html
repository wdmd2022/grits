 <pre>
    1  O thou my soul, bless God the Lord;
           and all that in me is
        Be stirred up his holy name
           to magnify and bless.
 </pre>

  <pre>
     2  Bless, O my soul, the Lord thy God,
           and not forgetful be
        Of all his gracious benefits
           he hath bestowed on thee.
  </pre>

  <pre>
     3  All thine iniquities who doth
           most graciously forgive:
        Who thy diseases all and pains
           doth heal, and thee relieve.
  </pre>

  <pre>
     4  Who doth redeem thy life, that thou
           to death may'st not go down;
        Who thee with loving-kindness doth
           and tender mercies crown:
  </pre>

  <pre>
     5  Who with abundance of good things
           doth satisfy thy mouth;
        So that, ev'n as the eagle's age,
           renewed is thy youth.
  </pre>

  <pre>
     6  God righteous judgment executes
           for all oppressed ones.
     7  His ways to Moses, he his acts
           made known to Isr'el's sons.
  </pre>

  <pre>
     8  The Lord our God is merciful,
           and he is gracious,
        Long-suffering, and slow to wrath,
           in mercy plenteous.
  </pre>

  <pre>
     9  He will not chide continually,
           nor keep his anger still.
      10  With us he dealt not as we sinned,
           nor did requite our ill.
  </pre>

 <pre>
    11  For as the heaven in its height
           the earth surmounteth far;
        So great to those that do him fear
            his tender mercies are:
 </pre>

 <pre>
    12  As far as east is distant from
           the west, so far hath he
        From us removed, in his love,
           all our iniquity.
 </pre>

 <pre>
    13  Such pity as a father hath
           unto his children dear;
        Like pity shews the Lord to such
           as worship him in fear.
 </pre>

 <pre>
    14  For he remembers we are dust,
           and he our frame well knows.
    15  Frail man, his days are like the grass,
           as flow'r in field he grows:
 </pre>

 <pre>
    16  For over it the wind doth pass,
           and it away is gone;
        And of the place where once it was
           it shall no more be known.
 </pre>

 <pre>
    17  But unto them that do him fear
           God's mercy never ends;
        And to their children's children still
           his righteousness extends:
 </pre>

 <pre>
    18  To such as keep his covenant,
           and mindful are alway
        Of his most just commandements,
           that they may them obey.
 </pre>

 <pre>
    19  The Lord prepared hath his throne
           in heavens firm to stand;
        And ev'ry thing that being hath
           his kingdom doth command.
 </pre>

 <pre>
    20  O ye his angels, that excel
           in strength, bless ye the Lord;
        Ye who obey what he commands,
           and hearken to his word.
 </pre>

 <pre>
    21  O bless and magnify the Lord,
           ye glorious hosts of his;
        Ye ministers, that do fulfil
           whate'er his pleasure is.
 </pre>

 <pre>
    22  O bless the Lord, all ye his works,
           wherewith the world is stored
        In his dominions ev'ry where.
           My soul, bless thou the Lord.
