<pre>   1  Praise waits for thee in Zion, Lord:
         to thee vows paid shall be.
   2  O thou that hearer art of pray'r,
         all flesh shall come to thee.</pre>

<pre>   3  Iniquities, I must confess,
         prevail against me do:
      But as for our transgressions,
         them purge away shalt thou.</pre>

<pre>   4  Blessed is the man whom thou dost choose,
         and mak'st approach to thee,
      That he within thy courts, O Lord,
         may still a dweller be:</pre>

<pre>      We surely shall be satisfied
         with thy abundant grace,
      And with the goodness of thy house,
         ev'n of thy holy place.</pre>

<pre>   5  O God of our salvation,
         thou, in thy righteousness,
      By fearful works unto our pray'rs
         thine answer dost express:</pre>

<pre>      Therefore the ends of all the earth,
         and those afar that be
      Upon the sea, their confidence,
         O Lord, will place in thee.</pre>

<pre>   6  Who, being girt with pow'r, sets fast
         by his great strength the hills.
   7  Who noise of seas, noise of their waves,
         and people's tumult, stills.</pre>

<pre>   8  Those in the utmost parts that dwell
         are at thy signs afraid:
      Th' outgoings of the morn and ev'n
         by thee are joyful made.</pre>

<pre>   9  The earth thou visit'st, wat'ring it;
         thou mak'st it rich to grow
      With God's full flood; thou corn prepar'st,
         when thou provid'st it so.</pre>

<pre>  10  Her rigs thou wat'rest plenteously,
         her furrows settelest:
      With show'rs thou dost her mollify,
         her spring by thee is blest.</pre>

<pre>  11  So thou the year most lib'rally
         dost with thy goodness crown;
      And all thy paths abundantly
         on us drop fatness down.</pre>

<pre>  12  They drop upon the pastures wide,
         that do in deserts lie;
      The little hills on ev'ry side
         rejoice right pleasantly.</pre>

<pre>  13  With flocks the pastures clothed be,
         the vales with corn are clad;
      And now they shout and sing to thee,
         for thou hast made them glad.</pre>
