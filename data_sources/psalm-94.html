<pre>   1  O Lord God, unto whom alone
         all vengeance doth belong;
      O mighty God, who vengeance own'st,
         shine forth, avenging wrong.</pre>

<pre>   2  Lift up thyself, thou of the earth
         the sov'reign Judge that art;
      And unto those that are so proud
         a due reward impart.</pre>

<pre>   3  How long, O mighty God, shall they
         who lewd and wicked be,
      How long shall they who wicked are
         thus triumph haughtily?</pre>

<pre>   4  How long shall things most hard by them
         be utter-ed and told?
      And all that work iniquity
         to boast themselves be bold?</pre>

<pre>   5  Thy folk they break in pieces, Lord,
         thine heritage oppress:
   6  The widow they and stranger slay,
         and kill the fatherless.</pre>

<pre>   7  Yet say they, God it shall not see,
         nor God of Jacob know.
   8  Ye brutish people! understand;
         fools! when wise will ye grow?</pre>

<pre>   9  The Lord did plant the ear of man,
         and hear then shall not he?
      He only formed the eye, and then
         shall he not clearly see?</pre>

<pre>  10  He that the nations doth correct,
         shall he not chastise you?
      He knowledge unto man doth teach,
         and shall himself not know?</pre>

<pre>  11  Man's thoughts to be but vanity
         the Lord doth well discern.
  12  Blessed is the man thou chast'nest, Lord,
         and mak'st thy law to learn:</pre>

<pre>  13  That thou may'st give him rest from days
         of sad adversity,
      Until the pit be digged for those
         that work iniquity.</pre>

<pre>  14  For sure the Lord will not cast off
         those that his people be,
      Neither his own inheritance
         quit and forsake will he:</pre>

<pre>  15  But judgment unto righteousness
         shall yet return again;
      And all shall follow after it
         that are right-hearted men.</pre>

<pre>  16  Who will rise up for me against
         those that do wickedly?
      Who will stand up for me 'gainst those
         that work iniquity?</pre>

<pre>  17  Unless the Lord had been my help
         when I was sore oppressed,
      Almost my soul had in the house
         of silence been at rest.</pre>

<pre>  18  When I had utter-ed this word,
         (my foot doth slip away,)
      Thy mercy held me up, O Lord,
         thy goodness did me stay.</pre>

<pre>  19  Amidst the multitude of thoughts
         which in my heart do fight,
      My soul, lest it be overcharged,
         thy comforts do delight.</pre>

<pre>  20  Shall of iniquity the throne
         have fellowship with thee,
      Which mischief, cunningly contrived,
         doth by a law decree?</pre>

<pre>  21  Against the righteous souls they join,
         they guiltless blood condemn.
  22  But of my refuge God's the rock,
         and my defense from them.</pre>

<pre>  23  On them their own iniquity
         the Lord shall bring and lay,
      And cut them off in their own sin;
         our Lord God shall them slay.</pre>
