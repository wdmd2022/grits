 <pre>
        1  Give thanks to God, call on his name;
               to men his deeds make known.
         2  Sing ye to him, sing psalms; proclaim
               his wondrous works each one.
 </pre>

  <pre>
         3  See that ye in his holy name
               to glory do accord;
            And let the heart of ev'ry one
               rejoice that seeks the Lord.
  </pre>

  <pre>
         4  The Lord Almighty, and his strength,
               with steadfast hearts seek ye:
            His bless-ed and his gracious face
               seek ye continually.
  </pre>

  <pre>
         5  Think on the works that he hath done,
               which admiration breed;
            His wonders, and the judgments all
               which from his mouth proceed;
  </pre>

  <pre>
         6  O ye that are of Abr'ham's race,
               his servant well approv'n;
            And ye that Jacob's children are,
               whom he chose for his own.
  </pre>

  <pre>
         7  Because he, and he only, is
               the mighty Lord our God;
            And his most righteous judgments are
               in all the earth abroad.
  </pre>

  <pre>
         8  His cov'nant he remembered hath,
               that it may ever stand:
            To thousand generations
               the word he did command.
  </pre>

  <pre>
         9  Which covenant he firmly made
               with faithful Abraham,
            And unto Isaac, by his oath,
               he did renew the same:
  </pre>

 <pre>
        10  And unto Jacob, for a law,
               he made it firm and sure,
            A covenant to Israel,
               which ever should endure.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        11  He said, I'll give Canaan's land
               for heritage to you;
        12  While they were strangers there, and few,
               in number very few:
 </pre>

 <pre>
        13  While yet they went from land to land
               without a sure abode;
            And while through sundry kingdoms they
               did wander far abroad;
 </pre>

 <pre>
        14  Yet, notwithstanding suffered he
               no man to do them wrong:
            Yea, for their sakes, he did reprove
               kings, who were great and strong.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        15  Thus did he say, Touch ye not those
               that mine anointed be,
            Nor do the prophets any harm
               that do pertain to me.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        16  He called for famine on the land,
               he brake the staff of bread:
        17  But yet he sent a man before,
               by whom they should be fed;
 </pre>

     <pre>
            Ev'n Joseph, whom unnat'rally
               sell for a slave did they;
             18  Whose feet with fetters they did hurt,
               and he in irons lay;
     </pre>

 <pre>
        19  Until the time that his word came
               to give him liberty;
            The word and purpose of the Lord
               did him in prison try.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        20  Then sent the king, and did command
               that he enlarged should be:
            He that the people's ruler was
               did send to set him free.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        21  A lord to rule his family
               he raised him, as most fit;
            To him of all that he possessed
               he did the charge commit:
 </pre>

 <pre>
        22  That he might at his pleasure bind
               the princes of the land;
            And he might teach his senators
               wisdom to understand.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        23  The people then of Israel
               down into Egypt came;
            And Jacob also sojourned
               within the land of Ham.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        24  And he did greatly by his pow'r
               increase his people there;
            And stronger than their enemies
               they by his blessing were.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        25  Their heart he turned to envy
               his folk maliciously,
            With those that his own servants were
               to deal in subtlety.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        26  His servant Moses he did send,
               Aaron his chosen one.
        27  By these his signs and wonders great
               in Ham's land were made known.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        28  Darkness he sent, and made it dark;
               his word they did obey.
        29  He turned their waters into blood,
               and he their fish did slay.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        30  The land in plenty brought forth frogs
               in chambers of their kings.
        31  His word all sorts of flies and lice
               in all their borders brings.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        32  He hail for rain, and flaming fire
               into their land he sent:
        33  And he their vines and fig-trees smote:
               trees of their coasts he rent.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        34  He spake, and caterpillars came,
               locusts did much abound;
        35  Which in their land all herbs consumed,
               and all fruits of their ground.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        36  He smote all first-born in their land,
               chief of their strength each one.
        37  With gold and silver brought them forth,
               weak in their tribes were none.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        38  Egypt was glad when forth they went,
               their fear on them did light.
        39  He spread a cloud for covering,
               and fire to shine by night.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        40  They asked, and he brought quails: with bread
               of heav'n he fill-ed them.
        41  He opened rocks, floods gushed, and ran
               in deserts like a stream.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        42  For on his holy promise he,
               and servant Abr'ham, thought.
        43  With joy his people, his elect
               with gladness, forth he brought.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        44  And unto them the pleasant lands
               he of the heathen gave;
            That of the people's labor they
               inheritance might have.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        45  That they his statutes might observe
               according to his word;
            And that they might his laws obey.
               Give praise unto the Lord.
