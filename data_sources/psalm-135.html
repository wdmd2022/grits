 <pre>
    1  Praise ye the Lord, the Lord's name praise;
          his servants, praise ye God.
    2  Who stand in God's house, in the courts
          of our God make abode.
 </pre>

 <pre>
    3  Praise ye the Lord, for he is good;
          unto him praises sing:
       Sing praises to his name, because
          it is a pleasant thing.
 </pre>

 <pre>
    4  For Jacob to himself the Lord
          did choose of his good pleasure,
       And he hath chosen Israel
          for his peculiar treasure.
 </pre>

 <pre>
    5  Because I know assuredly
          the Lord is very great,
       And that our Lord above all gods
          in glory hath his seat.
 </pre>

 <pre>
    6  What things soever pleased the Lord,
          that in the heav'n did he,
       And in the earth, the seas, and all
          the places deep that be.
 </pre>

 <pre>
    7  He from the ends of earth doth make
          the vapors to ascend;
       With rain he lightnings makes, and wind
          doth from his treasures send.
 </pre>

 <pre>
    8  Egypt's first-born, from man to beast
    9      who smote. Strange tokens he
       On Phar'oh and his servants sent,
          Egypt, in midst of thee.
 </pre>

<pre>
   10  He smote great nations, slew great kings:
   11     Sihon of Heshbon king,
       And Og of Bashan, and to nought
          did Canaan's kingdoms bring:
</pre>

<pre>
   12  And for a wealthy heritage
          their pleasant land he gave,
       An heritage which Israel,
          his chosen folk, should have.
</pre>

<pre>
   13  Thy name, O Lord, shall still endure,
          and thy memorial
       With honor shall continued be
          to generations all.
</pre>

<pre>
   14  For why? the righteous God will judge
          his people righteously;
       Concerning those that do him serve,
          himself repent will he.
</pre>

<pre>
   15  The idols of the nations
          of silver are and gold,
       And by the hands of men is made
          their fashion and mould.
</pre>

<pre>
   16  Mouths have they, but they do not speak;
          eyes, but they do not see;
   17  Ears have they, but hear not; and in
          their mouths no breathing be.
</pre>

<pre>
   18  Their makers are like them; so are
          all that on them rely.
   19  O Isr'el's house, bless God; bless God,
          O Aaron's family.
</pre>

<pre>
   20  O bless the Lord, of Levi's house
          ye who his servants are;
       And bless the holy name of God,
          all ye the Lord that fear.
</pre>

<pre>
   21  And blessed be the Lord our God
          from Zion's holy hill,
       Who dwelleth at Jerusalem.
          The Lord O praise ye still.
</pre>
