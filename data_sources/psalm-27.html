<p><em>A Psalm of David</em></p>

<pre>   1  The Lord's my light and saving health,
         who shall make me dismayed?
      My life's strength is the Lord, of whom
         then shall I be afraid?</pre>

<pre>   2  When as mine enemies and foes,
         most wicked persons all,
      To eat my flesh against me rose,
         they stumbled and did fall.</pre>

<pre>   3  Against me though an host encamp,
         my heart yet fearless is:
      Though  war against me rise, I will
         be confident in this.</pre>

<pre>   4  One thing I of the Lord desired,
         and will seek to obtain,
      That all days of my life I may
         within God's house remain;</pre>

<pre>      That I the beauty of the Lord
         behold may and admire,
      And that I in his holy place
         may rev'rently enquire.</pre>

<pre>   5  For he in his pavilion shall
         me hide in evil days;
      In secret of his tent me hide,
         and on a rock me raise.</pre>

<pre>   6  And now, ev'n at this present time,
         mine head shall lifted be
      Above all those that are my foes,
         and round encompass me:</pre>

<pre>      Therefore unto his tabernacle
         I'll sacrifices bring
      Of joyfulness; I'll sing, yea, I
         to God will praises sing.</pre>

<pre>   7  O Lord, give ear unto my voice,
         when I do cry to thee;
      Upon me also mercy have,
         and do thou answer me.</pre>

<pre>   8  When thou didst say, seek ye my face,
         then unto thee reply
      Thus did my heart, above all things
         thy face, Lord, seek will I.</pre>

<pre>   9  Far from me hide not thou thy face;
         put not away from thee
      Thy servant in thy wrath: thou hast
         an helper been to me.</pre>

<pre>      O God of my salvation,
         leave me not, nor forsake:
  10  Though me my parents both should leave,
         the Lord will me up take.</pre>

<pre>  11  O Lord, instruct me in thy way,
         to me a leader be
      In a plain path, because of those
         that hatred bear to me.</pre>

<pre>  12  Give me not to mine en'mies' will;
         for witnesses that lie
      Against me risen are, and such
         as breathe out cruelty.</pre>

<pre>  13  I fainted had, unless that I
         believed had to see
      The Lord's own goodness in the land
         of them that living be.</pre>

<pre>  14  Wait on the Lord, and be thou strong,
         and he shall strength afford
      Unto thine heart; yea, do thou wait,
         I say, upon the Lord.</pre>
