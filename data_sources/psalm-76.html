<pre>   1  In Judah's land God is well known,
         his name's in Isr'el great:
   2  In Salem is his tabernacle,
         in Zion is his seat.</pre>

<pre>   3  There arrows of the bow he brake,
         the shield, the sword, the war.
   4  More glorious thou than hills of prey,
         more excellent art far.</pre>

<pre>   5  Those that were stout of heart are spoiled,
         they slept their sleep outright;
      And none of those their hands did find,
         that were the men of might.</pre>

<pre>   6  When thy rebuke, O Jacob's God,
         had forth against them past,
      Their horses and their chariots both
         were in a dead sleep cast.</pre>

<pre>   7  Thou, Lord, ev'n thou art he that should
         be feared; and who is he
      That may stand up before thy sight,
         if once thou angry be?</pre>

<pre>   8  From heav'n thou judgment caused be heard;
         the earth was still with fear,
   9  When God to judgment rose, to save
         all meek on earth that were.</pre>

<pre>  10  Surely the very wrath of man
         unto thy praise redounds:
      Thou to the remnant of his wrath
         wilt set restraining bounds.</pre>

<pre>  11  Vow to the Lord your God, and pay:
         all ye that near him be,
      Bring gifts and presents unto him;
         for to be feared is he.</pre>

<pre>  12  By him the sp'rits shall be cut off
         of those that princes are:
      Unto the kings that are on earth
         he fearful doth appear.</pre>
