<blockquote>
  <p><em><font FACE="Times New Roman">A Psalm of Asaph. </font></em></p>
</blockquote>

<pre>   1  Yet God is good to Israel,
         to each pure-hearted one.
   2  But as for me, my steps near slipped,
         my feet were almost gone.</pre>

<pre>   3  For I envious was, and grudged
         the foolish folk to see,
      When I perceived the wicked sort
         enjoy prosperity.</pre>

<pre>   4  For still their strength continueth firm;
         their death of bands is free.
   5  They are not toiled like other men,
         nor plagued, as others be.</pre>

<pre>   6  Therefore their pride, like to a chain,
         them compasseth about;
      And, as a garment, violence
         doth cover them throughout.</pre>

<pre>   7  Their eyes stand out with fat; they have
         more than their hearts could wish.
   8  They are corrupt; their talk of wrong
         both lewd and lofty is.</pre>

<pre>   9  They set their mouth against the heav'ns
         in their blasphemous talk;
      And their reproaching tongue throughout
         the earth at large doth walk.</pre>

<pre>  10  His people oftentimes for this
         look back, and turn about;
      Sith waters of so full a cup
         to these are pour√®d out.</pre>

<pre>  11  And thus they say, How can it be
         that God these things doth know?
      Or, Can there in the Highest be
         knowledge of things below?</pre>

<pre>  12  Behold, these are the wicked ones,
         yet prosper at their will
      In worldly things; they do increase
         in wealth and riches still.</pre>

<pre>  13  I verily have done in vain
         my heart to purify;
      To no effect in innocence
         washed my hands have I.</pre>

<pre>  14  For daily, and all day throughout,
         great plagues I suffered have;
      Yea, ev'ry morning I of new
         did chastisement receive.</pre>

<pre>  15  If in this manner foolishly
         to speak I would intend,
      Thy children's generation,
         behold, I should offend.</pre>

<pre>  16  When I this thought to know, it was
         too hard a thing for me;
  17  Till to God's sanctuary I went,
         then I their end did see.</pre>

<pre>  18  Assuredly thou didst them set
         a slipp'ry place upon;
      Them suddenly thou castedst down
         into destruction.</pre>

<pre>  19  How in a moment suddenly
         to ruin brought are they!
      With fearful terrors utterly
         they are consumed away.</pre>

<pre>  20  Ev'n like unto a dream, when one
         from sleeping doth arise;
      So thou, O Lord, when thou awak'st,
         their image shalt despise.</pre>

<pre>  21  Thus grieved was my heart in me,
         and me my reins oppressed:
  22  So rude was I, and ignorant,
         and in thy sight a beast.</pre>

<pre>  23  Nevertheless continually,
         O Lord, I am with thee:
      Thou dost me hold by my right hand,
         and still upholdest me.</pre>

<pre>  24  Thou, with thy counsel, while I live,
         wilt me conduct and guide;
      And to thy glory afterward
         receive me to abide.</pre>

<pre>  25  Whom have I in the heavens high
         but thee, O Lord, alone?
      And in the earth whom I desire
         besides thee there is none.</pre>

<pre>  26  My flesh and heart doth faint and fail,
         but God doth fail me never:
      For of my heart God is the strength
         and portion for ever.</pre>

<pre>  27  For, lo, they that are far from thee
         for ever perish shall;
      Them that a whoring from thee go
         thou hast destroyed all.</pre>

<pre>  28  But surely it is good for me
         that I draw near to God:
      In God I trust, that all thy works
         I may declare abroad.</pre>
