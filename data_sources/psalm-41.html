  <p><em><font FACE="Times New Roman">To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David. </font></em></p>

<pre>   1  Blessed is he that wisely doth
         the poor man's case consider;
      For when the time of trouble is,
         the Lord will him deliver.</pre>

<pre>   2  God will him keep, yea, save alive;
         on earth he blessed shall live;
      And to his enemies' desire
         thou wilt him not up give.</pre>

<pre>   3  God will give strength when he on bed
         of languishing doth mourn;
      And in his sickness sore, O Lord,
         thou all his bed wilt turn.</pre>

<pre>   4  I said, O Lord, do thou extend
         thy mercy unto me;
      O do thou heal my soul; for why?
         I have offended thee.</pre>

<pre>   5  Those that to me are enemies,
         of me do evil say,
      When shall he die, that so his name
         may perish quite away?</pre>

<pre>   6  To see me if he comes, he speaks
         vain words: but then his heart
      Heaps mischief to it, which he tells,
         when forth he doth depart.</pre>

<pre>   7  My haters jointly whispering,
         'gainst me my hurt devise.
   8  Mischief, say they, cleaves fast to him;
         he li'th, and shall not rise.</pre>

<pre>   9  Yea, ev'n mine own familiar friend,
         on whom I did rely,
      Who ate my bread, ev'n he his heel
         against me lifted high.</pre>

<pre>  10  But, Lord, be merciful to me,
         and up again me raise,
      That I may justly them requite
         according to their ways.</pre>

<pre>  11  By this I know that certainly
         I favored am by thee;
      Because my hateful enemy
         triumphs not over me.</pre>

<pre>  12  But as for me, thou me uphold'st
         in mine integrity;
      And me before thy countenance
         thou sett'st continually.</pre>

<pre>  13  The Lord, the God of Israel,
         be blessed for ever then,
      From age to age eternally.
         Amen, yea, and amen.</pre>
