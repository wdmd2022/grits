  <pre>
         1  I'll thee extol, my God, O King;
               I'll bless thy name always.
         2  Thee will I bless each day, and will
               thy name for ever praise.
  </pre>

  <pre>
         3  Great is the Lord, much to be praised;
               his greatness search exceeds.
         4  Race unto race shall praise thy works,
               and show thy mighty deeds.
  </pre>

  <pre>
         5  I of thy glorious majesty
               the honor will record;
            I'll speak of all thy mighty works,
               which wondrous are, O Lord.
  </pre>

  <pre>
         6  Men of thine acts the might shall show,
               thine acts that dreadful are;
            And I, thy glory to advance,
               thy greatness will declare.
  </pre>

  <pre>
         7  The mem'ry of thy goodness great
               they largely shall express;
            With songs of praise they shall extol
               thy perfect righteousness.
  </pre>

  <pre>
         8  The Lord is very gracious,
               in him compassions flow;
            In mercy he is very great,
               and is to anger slow.
  </pre>

  <pre>
         9  The Lord Jehovah unto all
               his goodness doth declare;
            And over all his other works
               his tender mercies are.
  </pre>

 <pre>
        10  Thee all thy works shall praise, O Lord,
               and thee thy saints shall bless;
        11  They shall thy kingdom's glory show,
               thy pow'r by speech express:
 </pre>

 <pre>
        12  To make the sons of men to know
               his acts done mightily,
            And of his kingdom th' excellent
               and glorious majesty.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        13  Thy kingdom shall for ever stand,
               thy reign through ages all.
        14  God raiseth all that are bowed down,
               upholdeth all that fall.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        15  The eyes of all things wait on thee,
               the giver of all good;
            And thou, in time convenient,
               bestow'st on them their food:
 </pre>

 <pre>
        16  Thine hand thou open'st lib'rally,
               and of thy bounty gives
            Enough to satisfy the need
               of ev'ry thing that lives.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        17  The Lord is just in all his ways,
               holy in his works all.
        18  God's near to all that call on him,
               in truth that on him call.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        19  He will accomplish the desire
               of those that do him fear:
            He also will deliver them,
               and he their cry will hear.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        20  The Lord preserves all who him love,
               that naught can them annoy:
            But he all those that wicked are
               will utterly destroy.
 </pre>

 <pre>
        21  My mouth the praises of the Lord
               to publish cease shall never:
            Let all flesh bless his holy name
               for ever and for ever.
 </pre>
