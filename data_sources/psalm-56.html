<pre><em>To the chief Musician upon Jonath-elem-rechokim, 
Michtam of David, when the Philistines took him in Gath
</em>
   1  Show mercy, Lord, to me, for man
         would swallow me outright;
      He me oppresseth, while he doth
         against me daily fight.</pre>

<pre>   2  They daily would me swallow up
         that hate me spitefully;
      For they be many that do fight
         against me, O most High.</pre>

<pre>   3  When I'm afraid I'll trust in thee:
   4     In God I'll praise his word;
      I will not fear what flesh can do,
         my trust is in the Lord.</pre>

<pre>   5  Each day they wrest my words; their thoughts
         'gainst me are all for ill.
   6  They meet, they lurk, they mark my steps,
         waiting my soul to kill.</pre>

<pre>   7  But shall they by iniquity
         escape thy judgments so?
      O God, with indignation down
         do thou the people throw.</pre>

<pre>   8  My wand'rings all what they have been
         thou know'st, their number took;
      Into thy bottle put my tears:
         are they not in thy book?</pre>

<pre>   9  My foes shall, when I cry, turn back;
         I know't, God is for me.
  10  In God his word I'll praise; his word
         in God shall praised be.</pre>

<pre>  11  In God I trust; I will not fear
         what man can do to me.
  12  Thy vows upon me are, O God:
         I'll render praise to thee.</pre>

<pre>  13  Wilt thou not, who from death me saved,
         my feet from falls keep free,
      To walk before God in the light
         of those that living be?</pre>
