<p><em>To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David, the servant <big><br>
</big>of the Lord, who spake unto the Lord the words of <big><br>
</big>this song in the day that the Lord delivered him <big><br>
</big>from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand <big><br>
</big>of Saul: And he said,</em></p>

<pre>   1  Thee will I love, O Lord, my strength.
   2     My fortress is the Lord,
      My rock, and he that doth to me
         deliverance afford:</pre>

<pre>      My God, my strength, whom I will trust,
         a buckler unto me,
      The horn of my salvation,
         and my high tow'r, is he.</pre>

<pre>   3  Upon the Lord, who worthy is
         of praises, will I cry;
      And then shall I preserved be
         safe from mine enemy.</pre>

<pre>   4  Floods of ill men affrighted me,
         death's pangs about me went;
   5  Hell's sorrows me environed;
         death's snares did me prevent.</pre>

<pre>   6  In my distress I called on God,
         cry to my God did I;
      He from his temple heard my voice,
         to his ears came my cry.</pre>

<pre>   7  Th' earth, as affrighted, then did shake,
         trembling upon it seized:
      The hills' foundations moved were,
         because he was displeased.</pre>

<pre>   8  Up from his nostrils came a smoke,
         and from his mouth there came
      Devouring fire, and coals by it
         were turned into flame.</pre>

<pre>   9  He also bowed down the heav'ns,
         and thence he did descend;
      And thickest clouds of darkness did
         under his feet attend.</pre>

<pre>  10  And he upon a cherub rode,
         and thereon he did fly;
      Yea, on the swift wings of the wind
         his flight was from on high.</pre>

<pre>  11  He darkness made his secret place:
         about him, for his tent,
      Dark waters were, and thickest clouds
         of th' airy firmament.</pre>

<pre>  12  And at the brightness of that light,
         which was before his eye,
      His thick clouds passed away, hailstones
         and coals of fire did fly.</pre>

<pre>  13  The Lord God also in the heav'ns
         did thunder in his ire;
      And there the Highest gave his voice,
         hailstones and coals of fire.</pre>

<pre>  14  Yea, he his arrows sent abroad,
         and them he scattered;
      His lightnings also he shot out,
         and them discomfited.</pre>

<pre>  15  The waters' channels then were seen,
         the world's foundations vast
      At thy rebuke discovered were,
         and at thy nostrils' blast.</pre>

<pre>  16  And from above the Lord sent down,
         and took me from below;
      From many waters he me drew,
         which would me overflow.</pre>

<pre>  17  He me relieved from my strong foes,
         and such as did me hate;
      Because he saw that they for me
         too strong were, and too great.</pre>

<pre>  18  They me prevented in the day
         of my calamity;
      But even then the Lord himself
         a stay was unto me.</pre>

<pre>  19  He to a place where liberty
         and room was hath me brought;
      Because he took delight in me,
         he my deliv'rance wrought.</pre>

<pre>  20  According to my righteousness
         he did me recompense,
      He me repaid according to
         my hands' pure innocence.</pre>

<pre>  21  For I God's ways kept, from my God
         did not turn wickedly.
  22  His judgments were before me, I
         his laws put not from me.</pre>

<pre>23  Sincere before him was my heart;
       with him upright was I;
    And watchfully I kept myself
       from mine iniquity.  </pre>

<pre>  24  After my righteousness the Lord
         hath recompensed me,
      After the cleanness of my hands
         appearing in his eye.  </pre>

<pre>  25  Thou gracious to the gracious art,
         to upright men upright:
  26  Pure to the pure, froward thou kyth'st
         unto the froward wight.  </pre>

<pre>  27  For thou wilt the afflicted save
         in grief that low do lie:
      But wilt bring down the countenance
         of them whose looks are high.  </pre>

<pre>  28  The Lord will light my candle so,
         that it shall shine full bright:
      The Lord my God will also make
         my darkness to be light.  </pre>

<pre>  29  By thee through troops of men I break,
         and them discomfit all;
      And, by my God assisting me,
         I overleap a wall.  </pre>

<pre>  30  As for God, perfect is his way:
         the Lord his word is try'd;
      He is a buckler to all those
         who do in him confide.  </pre>

<pre>  31  Who but the Lord is God? but he
         who is a rock and stay?
  32  'Tis God that girdeth me with strength,
         and perfect makes my way.  </pre>

<pre>  33  He made my feet swift as the hinds,
         set me on my high places.
  34  Mine hands to war he taught, mine arms
         brake bows of steel in pieces.  </pre>

<pre>  35  The shield of thy salvation
         thou didst on me bestow:
      Thy right hand held me up, and great
         thy kindness made me grow.  </pre>

<pre>  36  And in my way my steps thou hast
         enlarged under me,
      That I go safely, and my feet
         are kept from sliding free.  </pre>

<pre>  37  Mine en'mies I pursued have,
         and did them overtake;
      Nor did I turn again till I
         an end of them did make.  </pre>

<pre>  38  I wounded them, they could not rise;
         they at my feet did fall.
  39  Thou girdedst me with strength for war;
         my foes thou brought'st down all:  </pre>

<pre>  40  And thou hast giv'n to me the necks
         of all mine enemies;
      That I might them destroy and slay,
         who did against me rise.  </pre>

<pre>  41  They cried out, but there was none
         that would or could them save;
      Yea, they did cry unto the Lord,
         but he no answer gave.  </pre>

<pre>  42  Then did I beat them small as dust
         before the wind that flies;
      And I did cast them out like dirt
         upon the street that lies.  </pre>

<pre>  43  Thou mad'st me free from people's strife,
         and heathen's head to be:
      A people whom I have not known
         shall service do to me.  </pre>

<pre>  44  At hearing they shall me obey,
         to me they shall submit.
  45  Strangers for fear shall fade away,
         who in close places sit.  </pre>

<pre>  46  God lives, blessed be my Rock; the God
         of my health praised be.
  47  God doth avenge me, and subdues
         the people under me.  </pre>

<pre>  48  He saves me from mine enemies;
         yea, thou hast lifted me
      Above my foes; and from the man
         of vi'lence set me free.  </pre>

<pre>  49  Therefore to thee will I give thanks
         the heathen folk among;
      And to thy name, O Lord, I will
         sing praises in a song.  </pre>

<pre>  50  He great deliv'rance gives his king:
         he mercy doth extend
      To David, his anointed one,
         and his seed without end.</pre>
