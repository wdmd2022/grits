  <p><em><font FACE="Times New Roman">To the chief Musician, to Jeduthun, A Psalm of Asaph. </font></em></p>

<pre>   1  Unto the Lord I with my voice,
         I unto God did cry;
      Ev'n with my voice, and unto me
         his ear he did apply.</pre>

<pre>   2  I in my trouble sought the Lord,
         my sore by night did run,
      And ceasèd not; my grievèd soul
         did consolation shun.</pre>

<pre>   3  I to remembrance God did call,
         yet trouble did remain;
      And overwhelm'd my spirit was,
         whilst I did sore complain.</pre>

<pre>   4  Mine eyes, debarred from rest and sleep,
         thou makest still to wake;
      My trouble is so great that I
         unable am to speak.</pre>

<pre>   5  The days of old to mind I called,
         and oft did think upon
      The times and ages that are past
         full many years agone.</pre>

<pre>   6  By night my song I call to mind,
         and commune with my heart;
      My sp'rit did carefully enquire
         how I might ease my smart.</pre>

<pre>   7  For ever will the Lord cast off,
         and gracious be no more?
   8  For ever is his mercy gone?
         fails his word evermore?</pre>

<pre>   9  Is't true that to be gracious
         the Lord forgotten hath?
      And that his tender mercies he
         hath shut up in his wrath?</pre>

<pre>  10  Then did I say, That surely this
         is mine infirmity:
      I'll mind the years of the right hand
         of him that is most High.</pre>

<pre>  11  Yea, I remember will the works
         performed by the Lord:
      The wonders done of old by thee
         I surely will record.</pre>

<pre>  12  I also will of all thy works
         my meditation make;
      And of thy doings to discourse
         great pleasure I will take.</pre>

<pre>  13  O God, thy way most holy is
         within thy sanctuary;
      And what god is so great in pow'r
         as is our God most high?</pre>

<pre>  14  Thou art the God that wonders do'st
         by thy right hand most strong:
      Thy mighty pow'r thou hast declared
         the nations among.</pre>

<pre>  15  To thine own people with thine arm
         thou didst redemption bring;
      To Jacob's sons, and to the tribes
         of Joseph that do spring.</pre>

<pre>  16  The waters, Lord, perceivèd thee,
         the waters saw thee well;
      And they for fear aside did flee;
         the depths on trembling fell.</pre>

<pre>  17  The clouds in water forth were poured,
         sound loudly did the sky;
      And swiftly through the world abroad
         thine arrows fierce did fly.</pre>

<pre>  18  Thy thunder's voice alongst the heav'n
         a mighty noise did make;
      By lightnings lightened was the world,
         th' earth tremble did and shake.</pre>

<pre>  19  Thy way is in the sea, and in
         the waters great thy path;
      Yet are thy footsteps hid, O Lord;
         none knowledge thereof hath.</pre>

<pre>  20  Thy people thou didst safely lead,
         like to a flock of sheep;
      By Moses' hand and Aaron's thou
         didst them conduct and keep.</pre>
