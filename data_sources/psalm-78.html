<pre>   1  Attend, my people, to my law;
         thereto give thou an ear;
      The words that from my mouth proceed
         attentively do hear.</pre>

<pre>   2  My mouth shall speak a parable,
         and sayings dark of old;
   3  The same which we have heard and known,
         and us our fathers told.</pre>

<pre>   4  We also will them not conceal
         from their posterity;
      Them to the generation
         to come declare will we:</pre>

<pre>      The praises of the Lord our God,
         and his almighty strength,
      The wondrous works that he hath done,
         we will show forth at length.</pre>

<pre>   5  His testimony and his law
         in Isr'el he did place,
      And charged our fathers it to show
         to their succeeding race;</pre>

<pre>   6  That so the race which was to come
         might well them learn and know;
      And sons unborn, who should arise,
         might to their sons them show:</pre>

<pre>   7  That they might set their hope in God,
         and suffer not to fall
      His mighty works out of their mind,
         but keep his precepts all:</pre>

<pre>   8  And might not, like their fathers, be
         a stiff rebellious race;
      A race not right in heart; with God
         whose sp'rit not steadfast was.</pre>

<pre>   9  The sons of Ephraim, who nor bows
         nor other arms did lack,
      When as the day of battle was,
         they faintly turned back.</pre>

<pre>  10  They brake God's cov'nant, and refused
         in his commands to go;
  11  His works and wonders they forgot,
         which he to them did show.</pre>

<pre>  12  Things marvelous he brought to pass;
         their fathers them beheld
      Within the land of Egypt done,
         yea, ev'n in Zoan's field.</pre>

<pre>  13  By him divided was the sea,
         he caused them through to pass;
      And made the waters so to stand,
         as like an heap it was.</pre>

<pre>  14  With cloud by day, with light of fire
         all night, he did them guide.
  15  In desert rocks he clave, and drink,
         as from great depths, supplied.</pre>

<pre>  16  He from the rock brought streams, like floods
         made waters to run down.
  17  Yet sinning more, in desert they
         provoked the Highest One.</pre>

<pre>  18  For in their heart they tempted God,
         and, speaking with mistrust,
      They greedily did meat require
         to satisfy their lust.</pre>

<pre>  19  Against the Lord himself they spake,
         and, murmuring, said thus,
      A table in the wilderness
         can God prepare for us?</pre>

<pre>  20  Behold, he smote the rock, and thence
         came streams and waters great;
      But can he give his people bread?
         and send them flesh to eat?</pre>

<pre>  21  The Lord did hear, and waxed wroth;
         so kindled was a flame
      'Gainst Jacob, and 'gainst Israel
         up indignation came.</pre>

<pre>  22  For they believed not God, nor trust
         in his salvation had;
  23  Though clouds above he did command,
         and heav'n's doors open made,</pre>

<pre>  24  And manna rained on them, and gave
         them corn of heav'n to eat.
  25  Man angels' food did eat; to them
         he to the full sent meat.</pre>

<pre>  26  And in the heaven he did cause
         an eastern wind to blow;
      And by his power he let out
         the southern wind to go.</pre>

<pre>  27  Then flesh as thick as dust he made
         to rain down them among;
      And feathered fowls, like as the sand
         which li'th the shore along.</pre>

<pre>  28  At his command amidst their camp
         these show'rs of flesh down fell,
      All round about the tabernacles
         and tents where they did dwell.</pre>

<pre>  29  So they did eat abundantly,
         and had of meat their fill;
      For he did give to them what was
         their own desire and will.</pre>

<pre>  30  They from their lust had not estranged
         their heart and their desire;
      But while the meat was in their mouths,
         which they did so require,</pre>

<pre>  31  God's wrath upon them came, and slew
         the fattest of them all;
      So that the choice of Israel,
         o'erthrown by death, did fall.</pre>

<pre>  32  Yet, notwithstanding of all this,
         they sinned still the more;
      And though he had great wonders wrought,
         believed him not therefore:</pre>

<pre>  33  Wherefore their days in vanity
         he did consume and waste;
      And by his wrath their wretched years
         away in trouble past.</pre>

<pre>  34  But when he slew them, then they did
         to seek him show desire;
      Yea, they returned, and after God
         right early did enquire.</pre>

<pre>  35  And that the Lord had been their Rock,
         they did remember then;
      Ev'n that the high almighty God
         had their Redeemer been.</pre>

<pre>  36  Yet with their mouth they flattered him,
         and spake but feignedly;
      And they unto the God of truth
         with their false tongues did lie.</pre>

<pre>  37  For though their words were good, their heart
         with him was not sincere;
      Unsteadfast and perfidious
         they in his cov'nant were.</pre>

<pre>  38  But, full of pity, he forgave
         their sin, them did not slay;
      Nor stirred up all his wrath, but oft
         his anger turned away.</pre>

<pre>  39  For that they were but fading flesh
         to mind he did recall;
      A wind that passeth soon away,
         and not returns at all.</pre>

<pre>  40  How often did they him provoke
         within the wilderness!
      And in the desert did him grieve
         with their rebelliousness!</pre>

<pre>  41  Yea, turning back, they tempted God,
         and limits set upon
      Him, who in midst of Isr'el is
         the only Holy One.</pre>

<pre>  42  They did not call to mind his pow'r,
         nor yet the day when he
      Delivered them out of the hand
         of their fierce enemy;</pre>

<pre>  43  Nor how great signs in Egypt land
         he openly had wrought;
      What miracles in Zoan's field
         his hand to pass had brought.</pre>

<pre>  44  How lakes and rivers ev'ry where
         he turned into blood;
      So that nor man nor beast could drink
         of standing lake or flood.</pre>

<pre>  45  He brought among them swarms of flies,
         which did them sore annoy;
      And divers kinds of filthy frogs
         he sent them to destroy.</pre>

<pre>  46  He to the caterpillar gave
         the fruits of all their soil;
      Their labors he delivered up
         unto the locusts' spoil.</pre>

<pre>  47  Their vines with hail, their sycamores
         he with the frost did blast:
  48  Their beasts to hail he gave; their flocks
         hot thunderbolts did waste.</pre>

<pre>  49  Fierce burning wrath he on them cast,
         and indignation strong,
      And troubles sore, by sending forth
         ill angels them among.</pre>

<pre>  50  He to his wrath made way; their soul
         from death he did not save;
      But over to the pestilence
         the lives of them he gave.</pre>

<pre>  51  In Egypt land the first-born all
         he smote down ev'ry where;
      Among the tents of Ham, ev'n these
         chief of their strength that were.</pre>

<pre>  52  But his own people, like to sheep,
         thence to go forth he made;
      And he, amidst the wilderness,
         them, as a flock, did lead.</pre>

<pre>  53  And he them safely on did lead,
         so that they did not fear;
      Whereas their en'mies by the sea
         quite overwhelmed were.</pre>

<pre>  54  To borders of his sanctuary
         the Lord his people led,
      Ev'n to the mount which his right hand
         for them had purchased.</pre>

<pre>  55  The nations of Canaan,
         by his almighty hand,
      Before their face he did expel
         out of their native land;</pre>

<pre>      Which for inheritance to them
         by line he did divide,
      And made the tribes of Israel
         within their tents abide.</pre>

<pre>  56  Yet God most high they did provoke,
         and tempted ever still;
      And to observe his testimonies
         did not incline their will:</pre>

<pre>  57  But, like their fathers, turned back,
         and dealt unfaithfully:
      Aside they turned, like a bow
         that shoots deceitfully.</pre>

<pre>  58  For they to anger did provoke
         him with their places high;
      And with their graven images
         moved him to jealousy.</pre>

<pre>  59  When God heard this, he waxed wroth,
         and much loathed Isr'el then:
  60  So Shiloh's tent he left, the tent
         which he had placed with men.</pre>

<pre>  61  And he his strength delivered
         into captivity;
      He left his glory in the hand
         of his proud enemy.</pre>

<pre>  62  His people also he gave o'er
         unto the sword's fierce rage:
      So sore his wrath inflamed was
         against his heritage.</pre>

<pre>  63  The fire consumed their choice young men;
         their maids no marriage had;
  64  And when their priests fell by the sword,
         their wives no mourning made.</pre>

<pre>  65  But then the Lord arose, as one
         that doth from sleep awake;
      And like a giant that, by wine
         refreshed, a shout doth make:</pre>

<pre>  66  Upon his en'mies' hinder parts
         he made his stroke to fall;
      And so upon them he did put
         a shame perpetual.</pre>

<pre>  67  Moreover, he the tabernacle
         of Joseph did refuse;
      The mighty tribe of Ephraim
         he would in no wise choose:</pre>

<pre>  68  But he did choose Jehudah's tribe
         to be the rest above;
      And of mount Zion he made choice,
         which he so much did love.</pre>

<pre>  69  And he his sanctuary built
         like to a palace high,
      Like to the earth which he did found
         to perpetuity.</pre>

<pre>  70  Of David, that his servant was,
         he also choice did make,
      And even from the folds of sheep
         was pleasèd him to take:</pre>

<pre>  71  From waiting on the ewes with young,
         he brought him forth to feed
      Israel, his inheritance,
         his people, Jacob's seed.</pre>

<pre>  72  So after the integrity
         he of his heart them fed;
      And by the good skill of his hands
         them wisely governèd.</pre>
